# Anyone can borrow with a low interest rate in the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`.

## Summary

The interest rate of a loan is determined before borrowing, so anyone can borrow with a low interest rate by manipulating the utilization ratio of `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.getMinInterestRate()` is calculated based on the utilization ratio.

```solidity
    function getMinInterestRate() public view returns (uint16) {
        return interestRateLowerBound + uint16( uint256(interestRateUpperBound-interestRateLowerBound).percent(getPoolUtilizationRatio()) );
    }
```

However, before borrowing, anybody can intentionally lower the utilization ratio by depositing a large amount of assets. Then, after borrowing, they can withdraw their assets and incur no loss, and the interest rate will be close to the `interestRateLowerBound`. This could be done by a flashloan.

## Impact

At any time, borrowers can borrow with an interest rate that is nearly `interestRateLowerBound`.
