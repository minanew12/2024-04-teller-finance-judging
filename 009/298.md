# wrong implement of "_repayLoan"

## Summary
if paymentAmount < _owedAmount    in _repayLoan we are changing the loan details.
## Vulnerability Detail
 function _repayLoan(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Payment memory _payment,
        uint256 _owedAmount,
        bool _shouldWithdrawCollateral
    ) internal virtual {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];
        uint256 paymentAmount = _payment.principal + _payment.interest;

        RepMark mark = reputationManager.updateAccountReputation(
            bid.borrower,
            _bidId
        );

        // Check if we are sending a payment or amount remaining
        if (paymentAmount >= _owedAmount) {
            paymentAmount = _owedAmount;

            if (bid.state != BidState.LIQUIDATED) {
                bid.state = BidState.PAID;
            }

            // Remove borrower's active bid
            _borrowerBidsActive[bid.borrower].remove(_bidId);

            // If loan is is being liquidated and backed by collateral, withdraw and send to borrower
            if (_shouldWithdrawCollateral) {
                //   _getCollateralManagerForBid(_bidId).withdraw(_bidId);
                collateralManager.withdraw(_bidId);
            }

            emit LoanRepaid(_bidId);
        } else {
            emit LoanRepayment(_bidId);
        }

        _sendOrEscrowFunds(_bidId, _payment); //send or escrow the funds

        // update our mappings
 @>       bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.principal += _payment.principal;
  @>      bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.interest += _payment.interest;
   @>     bid.loanDetails.lastRepaidTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);

        // If the loan is paid in full and has a mark, we should update the current reputation
        if (mark != RepMark.Good) {
            reputationManager.updateAccountReputation(bid.borrower, _bidId);
        }
    }

## Impact
here if paymentAmount < _owedAmount , we are  updating the bid.loan details but that should be happening as bid.state is open ,it not closed.
