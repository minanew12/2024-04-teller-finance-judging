# Current system is not capable with Fee on transfer tokens

## Summary

Current asset-share calculation would become incorrect for fee-on transfer tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the assets in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` is fee-on-transfer tokens, since the amount of tokens received by contract will be less than `_amount`, the asset/share ratio will be set incorrectly.

## Impact

Users receive incorrect value of tokens with FoT tokens as assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When users deposit to `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`, _amount should be the asset received by the contract.

When users withdraw from `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`, _amount should be the asset sent by the contract.
