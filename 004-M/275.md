# `FlashRolloverLoan_G5#rolloverLoanWithFlash` does not support fee-on-transfer tokens


## Summary

When borrower calls `rolloverLoanWithFlash()`, for fee-on-transfer tokens, the contract may pay back the borrower more tokens than expected, causing a loss of funds, or even the entire call will revert due to not enough tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `FlashRolloverLoan_G5#rolloverLoanWithFlash`, users pass in a `_borrowerAmount` defining the amount of tokens that is used for this rolloverLoan action. However, for fee-on-transfer tokens, the actual amount of tokens is less than `_borrowerAmount`.

When the flashRollover action is finished, the remaining tokens are transferred back to the borrower, however, it assumes the contract received `_rolloverArgs.borrowerAmount` during the initial transfer, which is not true. This will end up paying back the borrower more tokens than expected, causing a loss of funds, or even the entire call will revert due to not enough tokens.

```solidity
    function rolloverLoanWithFlash(
        address _lenderCommitmentForwarder,
        uint256 _loanId,
        uint256 _flashLoanAmount,
        uint256 _borrowerAmount, //an additional amount borrower may have to add
        AcceptCommitmentArgs calldata _acceptCommitmentArgs
    ) external   {
        address borrower = TELLER_V2.getLoanBorrower(_loanId);
        require(borrower == msg.sender, "CommitmentRolloverLoan: not borrower");

        // Get lending token and balance before
        address lendingToken = TELLER_V2.getLoanLendingToken(_loanId);

        if (_borrowerAmount > 0) {
            IERC20(lendingToken).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
>               _borrowerAmount
            );
        }
    }

    function executeOperation(
        address _flashToken,
        uint256 _flashAmount,
        uint256 _flashFees,
        address _initiator,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external virtual onlyFlashLoanPool returns (bool) {
    	...
        uint256 fundsRemaining = acceptCommitmentAmount +
>           _rolloverArgs.borrowerAmount -
            repaymentAmount -
            _flashFees;

        if (fundsRemaining > 0) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(_flashToken).transfer(
                _rolloverArgs.borrower,
                fundsRemaining
            );
        }
    }
```

Note that the contest README states that any tokens compatible with Uniswap V3 should be supported, which includes fee-on-transfer tokens.

> We are allowing any standard token that would be compatible with Uniswap V3 to work with our codebase, just as was the case for the original audit of TellerV2.sol. The tokens are assumed to be able to work with Uniswap V3.

## Impact

For fee-on-transfer tokens, the contract may pay back the borrower more tokens than expected, causing a loss of funds, or even the entire call will revert due to not enough tokens.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Use the diff of tokens after calling `IERC20(lendingToken).transferFrom` instead of the user passed-in `_flashLoanAmount`.
