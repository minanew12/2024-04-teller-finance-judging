# LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart::addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup calculates `totalPrincipalTokensCommitted` wrong

## Summary
In `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart::addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup`, the user deposits `_amount` and receives shares for it. This amount is then added to the `totalPrincipalTokensCommitted` variable. While this should function properly with every ERC20 token, it does not take into consideration fee on transfer tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is how it gets calculated
```solidity
 function addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(
        uint256 _amount,
        address _sharesRecipient
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesAmount_) {
        //transfers the primary principal token from msg.sender into this contract escrow

        principalToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        sharesAmount_ = _valueOfUnderlying(_amount, sharesExchangeRate());

       
>>      totalPrincipalTokensCommitted += _amount;
        //principalTokensCommittedByLender[msg.sender] += _amount;

        //mint shares equal to _amount and give them to the shares recipient !!!
        poolSharesToken.mint(_sharesRecipient, sharesAmount_);
    }
```
It just adds the `_amount` to the `totalPrincipalTokensCommitted`

## Impact
This will lead to a wrong accounting if the `principalToken` is fee on transfer ERC20. This can also result in trying to give more principal to a borrower than it is available in the protocol in scenarios where the borrower wants to borrow 100% of the pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the `totalPrincipalTokensCommitted` like this
```diff
 function addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(
        uint256 _amount,
        address _sharesRecipient
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesAmount_) {
        //transfers the primary principal token from msg.sender into this contract escrow

+       uint256 amountBefore = principalToken.balanceOf(address(this));

        principalToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        sharesAmount_ = _valueOfUnderlying(_amount, sharesExchangeRate());

-       totalPrincipalTokensCommitted += _amount;
+       uint256 amountAfter = principalToken.balanceOf(address(this));
+       totalPrincipalTokensCommitted += amountAfter - amountBefore;

        //principalTokensCommittedByLender[msg.sender] += _amount;

        //mint shares equal to _amount and give them to the shares recipient !!!
        poolSharesToken.mint(_sharesRecipient, sharesAmount_);
    }
```
