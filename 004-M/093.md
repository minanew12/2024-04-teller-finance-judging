# `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol` doesn't work correctly with fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Summary

Some state variables of `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol` are not correct for fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol` doesn't account for the fee paid to transfer for fee-on-transfer tokens.

For example, in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup()`, `totalPrincipalTokensCommitted` is not modified correctly at [L317](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L317), because it doesn't consider the fee paid to transfer.

```solidity
    function addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(
        uint256 _amount,
        address _sharesRecipient
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesAmount_) {
        //transfers the primary principal token from msg.sender into this contract escrow
        
        principalToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        sharesAmount_ = _valueOfUnderlying(_amount, sharesExchangeRate());

317     totalPrincipalTokensCommitted += _amount;
        //principalTokensCommittedByLender[msg.sender] += _amount;

        //mint shares equal to _amount and give them to the shares recipient !!!
        poolSharesToken.mint(_sharesRecipient, sharesAmount_);
    }
```

And incorrect state variables will impact all over the protocol and cause loss of funds.

This problem also occurs in several places.

## Impact

The protocol doesn't work correctly for fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A mechanism for fee-on-transfer tokens should be applied for all over the protocol.
