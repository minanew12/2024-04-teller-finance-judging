# `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` does not handle fee on transfer tokens correctly, leading to loss of funds

## Summary

`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` assumes that when calling `transferFrom()`, the amount passed as argument is the actual received amount, which is not the case for fee on transfer tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart::addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup()` calls `principalToken.transferFrom()` and adds the `amount` to `totalPrincipalTokensCommitted`. When calling `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart::burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings()`, the returned `principalToken` amount for the burned shares is calculated based on `totalPrincipalTokensCommitted`, which is bigger than the actual amount that the contract holds due to fees, so the transaction will revert.

## Impact

Stuck funds due to the fees charged by the token.

## Recommendation

Check the balance before and after transfers.
```solidity
uint256 prevAmount = principalToken.balanceOf(address(this));
principalToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
amount = principalToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - prevAmount;
```
