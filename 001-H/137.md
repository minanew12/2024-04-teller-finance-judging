# LenderCommitmentGroup Liquidations do not give collateral to liquidator

## Summary
In the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol` contract, anyone can liquidate a defaulted loan. The liquidator provides the proper amount of collateral and should be transferred the loan's collateral in exchange. However, the liquidation does not transfer the collateral to `msg.sender`. Instead, the collateral will be stuck in the `LenderCommitmentGroup` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
After transferring in the principal token from the liquidator, the `LenderCommitmentGroup` calls `ITellerV2(TELLER_V2).lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient(_bidId, msg.sender);`. The comment above this line states "//this will give collateral to the caller".

This doesn't actually give the collateral to the caller because `lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient()` does not withdraw to the recipient.

The Collateral Manager contract does not even contain a function to claim the collateral to an arbitrary recipient.

## Impact
- Loss of principal tokens for liquidators without receiving collateral reward

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Properly withdraw the collateral to the recipient by correctly implementing the function in the Collateral Manager.
