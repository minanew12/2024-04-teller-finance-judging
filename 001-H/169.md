# LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive() - The function doesn't send collateral to liquidator

## Summary
LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive() - The function doesn't send collateral to liquidator

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` there is a function [liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L422), which allow participants in the corresponding commitment group to liquidate a defaulted loan before it is publicly liquidatable trough `TellerV2` (24 hours after being defaulted).
The problem is that the function transfer from "liquidator" corresponding `bidId` due amount, but doesn't transfer him the freed collateral. Instead, collateral is transferred to `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` and it is locked there.

The problem comes from the following commented lines inside `TellerV2::_lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient`:

```solidity
        /*


          address collateralManagerForBid = address(_getCollateralManagerForBid(_bidId)); 

          if( collateralManagerForBid == address(collateralManagerV2) ){
             ICollateralManagerV2(collateralManagerForBid).lenderClaimCollateral(_bidId,_collateralRecipient);
          }else{
             require( _collateralRecipient == address(bid.lender));
             ICollateralManager(collateralManagerForBid).lenderClaimCollateral(_bidId );
          }
          
          */
```

Lets examine the following scenario:

- `BidId` is defaulted with 24 hours, because borrower has missed to pay his due amount of 1 ETH. 
He has deposited collateral of $5000 USDC to `collateralManager` for that corresponding `_bidId`. As the borrower has borrowed funds from `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart::acceptFundsForAcceptBid`, the lender for that `bidId` inside `TellerV2` is [LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L385) contract. 
- Now a liquidator calls `liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive` with corresponding `bidId` and `_tokenAmountDifference = 0`
[minAmountDifferance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L431)  is 0, because exactly `86400` has passed since loan defaulted timestamp.
As a result 1 ETH (amount due for the borrower) is transferred to the contract and loan is closed (assuming that collateral of $5000 will go to liquidator)
```solidity
else {
           
            uint256 tokensToGiveToSender = abs(_tokenAmountDifference);

            IERC20(principalToken).transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amountDue - tokensToGiveToSender
            );

            tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations -= int256(tokensToGiveToSender);

            totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += amountDue;
        }

        //this will give collateral to the caller
        ITellerV2(TELLER_V2).lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient(_bidId, msg.sender);

```
- But if we take a look inside [TellerV2(TELLER_V2).lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L738-L774), we notice that `_collateralRecipient` param is never used (there is commented lines, handling correctly that case), but right now, we will enter [CollateralManager::lenderClaimCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L271-L283), which will withdraw $5000 USDC (the collateral) to the lender of the loan (the CommitmentGroup) and those would be stuck there, as there is no function to withdraw, or distribute.

## Impact
Liquidators will not get any collateral when they liquidate a loan, effectively just repaying the entire debt, but they won't receive a thing back, thus they have no incentive to liquidate loans.
