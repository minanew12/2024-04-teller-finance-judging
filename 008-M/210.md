# DOS vulnerability in the rolloverLoanWithFlash function in FlashRolloverLoan_G5.sol

## Summary
https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#approval-race-protections
Some tokens (e.g. KNC) do not allow approving an amount M > 0 when an existing amount N > 0 is already approved.
`Note`: The KNC token returns true for the `transfer and transferFrom` functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
During the `rolloverLoanWithFlash` function call, the borrower repays the previous loan using borrowed principal tokens with an Aave simple flash loan. Here is how the `_repayLoanFull` function looks:
```solidity
function _repayLoanFull(
        uint256 _bidId,
        address _principalToken,
        uint256 _repayAmount
    ) internal returns (uint256 repayAmount_) {
        uint256 fundsBeforeRepayment = IERC20Upgradeable(_principalToken)
            .balanceOf(address(this));

-->     IERC20Upgradeable(_principalToken).approve(
            address(TELLER_V2),
            _repayAmount
        );
        TELLER_V2.repayLoanFull(_bidId);

        uint256 fundsAfterRepayment = IERC20Upgradeable(_principalToken)
            .balanceOf(address(this));

        repayAmount_ = fundsBeforeRepayment - fundsAfterRepayment;
    }
```

A malicious borrower can cause a Denial of Service (DOS) attack on all future `rolloverLoanWithFlash` executions with the KNS token as the principal token for other borrowers. This can be achieved by borrowing from an Aave flash loan with an amount of `owedPrincipal + interest + 1 wei` KNS of borrower's bid. After a successful execution, the borrower leaves an allowance of 1 wei, creating a DOS situation.
```solidity
// _repayAmount = owedPrincipal + interest + 1
 IERC20Upgradeable(_principalToken).approve(
            address(TELLER_V2),
            _repayAmount
        );
TELLER_V2.repayLoanFull(_bidId);      
// After repayLoanFull, 1 wei of allowance remains.
```

## Impact
A malicious borrower can cause a Denial of Service (DOS) attack on all future `rolloverLoanWithFlash` executions for non-zero approve tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is necessary to call `ITellerV2(TELLER_V2).calculateAmountOwed(_bidId, block.timestamp)` to calculate the total amount owed for a loan bid at a specific timestamp and approve it.
