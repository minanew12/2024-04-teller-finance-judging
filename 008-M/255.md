# Did Not Approve To Zero First

## Summary
Allowance was not set to zero first before changing the allowance.
## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

The following attempt to call the approve() function without setting the allowance to zero first.
```solidity
    function acceptFundsForAcceptBid(
        address _borrower,
        uint256 _bidId,
        uint256 _principalAmount,
        uint256 _collateralAmount,
        address _collateralTokenAddress,
        uint256 _collateralTokenId, 
        uint32 _loanDuration,
        uint16 _interestRate
    ) external onlySmartCommitmentForwarder whenNotPaused {
        
        SNIP...
 
373:    principalToken.approve(address(TELLER_V2), _principalAmount);

        //do not have to spoof/forward as this contract is the lender !
        _acceptBidWithRepaymentListener(_bidId);

        SNIP...
    }
```
## Impact
A number of features within the vaults will not work if the approve function reverts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to set the allowance to zero before increasing the allowance and use `safeApprove/safeIncreaseAllowance`.
