# The lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient function is not functioning as expected

## Summary

The `lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient` function allows a lender to claim collateral for a defaulted loan. However, the recipient will not receive the collateral tokens; instead, the lender will receive them.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a lender of a bid calls `lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient`, they expect to receive collateral tokens at the `_collateralRecipient` address, but this does not occur.
The `lenderClaimCollateral` function in the `CollateralManager` smart contract sends collateral to the lender and not to the `_collateralRecipient`.
```solidity
function _lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient(
        uint256 _bidId,
        address _collateralRecipient
    ) internal acceptedLoan(_bidId, "lenderClaimCollateral") {
        require(isLoanDefaulted(_bidId), "Loan must be defaulted.");

        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];
        bid.state = BidState.CLOSED;

        address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
        require(sender == bid.lender, "only lender can close loan");

        collateralManager.lenderClaimCollateral(_bidId); // transfer collateral to the lender

        emit LoanClosed(_bidId);
    }
```

## Impact
The collateral tokens will not be received by the specified recipient; they will be received by the lender which isn't expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The only solution to fix this issue is to change the logic of the out-of-scope `lenderClaimCollateral` function. Otherwise, `lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient` will not work as expected, and this function can simply be deleted.
