# Liquidations in the Lender Commitment Group don't include owed interest

## Summary
Liquidations in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol` do not include the owed interest. This creates a weird dynamic where it may be beneficial for a borrower to default the loan and self-liquidate intead of paying the owed interest.

## Vulnerability Detail
When liquidating a loan in the LendeCommitmentGroup contract, the `amountOwed` is calculated as such:

```solidity
        uint256 amountDue = getAmountOwedForBid(_bidId, false);
```

```solidity
    function getAmountOwedForBid(uint256 _bidId, bool _includeInterest)
        public
        view
        virtual
        returns (uint256 amountOwed_)
    {
        Payment memory amountOwedPayment = ITellerV2(TELLER_V2)
            .calculateAmountOwed(_bidId, block.timestamp);


        amountOwed_ = _includeInterest
            ? amountOwedPayment.principal + amountOwedPayment.interest
            : amountOwedPayment.principal;
    }
```

Since liquidations do not include owed interest, it may be financially incentivized for borrowers to intentionally default their loans and liquidate themselves instead, given that there is no penalty or protocol fee taken from liquidations.

## Impact
- Avoidance of interest
- Creation of gaming dynamics for borrowers
