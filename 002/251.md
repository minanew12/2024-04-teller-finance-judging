# ALL liquidation operations can be sandwiched to extract value from the protocol

## Summary

Currently, `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` does not use the normal IRM (Interest Rate Model). When liquidation happens, it distribute profit/socialize loss to ALL depositors, no matter how long they've been in the market. That makes it possible to sandwich liquidation to extract value from the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive(
        uint256 _bidId,
        int256 _tokenAmountDifference
    ) public bidIsActiveForGroup(_bidId) {

        ...

        if (_tokenAmountDifference > 0) {
            //this is used when the collateral value is higher than the principal (rare)
            //the loan will be completely made whole and our contract gets extra funds too
            uint256 tokensToTakeFromSender = abs(_tokenAmountDifference);

            IERC20(principalToken).transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amountDue + tokensToTakeFromSender
            );

            tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations += int256(tokensToTakeFromSender);

            totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += amountDue;
        } else {
           
            uint256 tokensToGiveToSender = abs(_tokenAmountDifference);

            IERC20(principalToken).transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amountDue - tokensToGiveToSender
            );

            tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations -= int256(tokensToGiveToSender);

            totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += amountDue;
        }

        //this will give collateral to the caller
        ITellerV2(TELLER_V2).lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient(_bidId, msg.sender);
    }

In liquidation function, `tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations` is updated immediately, which changes `sharesExchangeRate` at once.

So, an attacker can:

1. observe a liquidation which profit all LP.
2. frontrun the liquidation to `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup`.
3. liquidation is executed.
4. `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings` to profit and leave.

OR:

0. attacker already holds some shares.
1. observe a liquidation which profit all LP.
2. frontrun the liquidation to `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings`.
3. liquidation is executed.
4. `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup` to profit and leave.


## Impact

Attacker can make other users suffer more loss & earn less yield.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Here are some possible mitigations:

1. IRM models can be introduced.
2. imply a fee in withdraw.
