# A default loan's borrower can liquidate his own loan and get collateral back

## Summary
In [`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L422), there is no check on who can liquidate a default loan, in some cases, the borrower can liquidate himself at a low cost, also get his collaterals back.

## Vulnerability Detail
The liquidation in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` allows liquidators to liquidate a default loan, and get the reward of borrower's collaterals. However, as we can see in the function:

```solidity
    function liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive(
        uint256 _bidId,
        int256 _tokenAmountDifference
    ) public bidIsActiveForGroup(_bidId) {
        uint256 amountDue = getAmountOwedForBid(_bidId, false);

        uint256 loanDefaultedTimeStamp = ITellerV2(TELLER_V2)
            .getLoanDefaultTimestamp(_bidId);

        int256 minAmountDifference = getMinimumAmountDifferenceToCloseDefaultedLoan(
                amountDue,
                loanDefaultedTimeStamp
            );

        require(
            _tokenAmountDifference >= minAmountDifference,
            "Insufficient tokenAmountDifference"
        );

        if (_tokenAmountDifference > 0) {
            //this is used when the collateral value is higher than the principal (rare)
            //the loan will be completely made whole and our contract gets extra funds too
            uint256 tokensToTakeFromSender = abs(_tokenAmountDifference);

            IERC20(principalToken).transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amountDue + tokensToTakeFromSender
            );

            tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations += int256(tokensToTakeFromSender);

            totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += amountDue;
        } else {
           
            uint256 tokensToGiveToSender = abs(_tokenAmountDifference);

            IERC20(principalToken).transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amountDue - tokensToGiveToSender
            );

            tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations -= int256(tokensToGiveToSender);

            totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += amountDue;
        }

        //this will give collateral to the caller
        ITellerV2(TELLER_V2).lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient(_bidId, msg.sender);
    }
```

There is no limit on who can call this function, which means even the loan borrower can call it. The final cost is determined by the amount borrower has owed, but also time dependent as defined in `getMinimumAmountDifferenceToCloseDefaultedLoan`:

```solidity
    function getMinimumAmountDifferenceToCloseDefaultedLoan(
        uint256 _amountOwed,
        uint256 _loanDefaultedTimestamp
    ) public view virtual returns (int256 amountDifference_) {
        require(
            _loanDefaultedTimestamp > 0,
            "Loan defaulted timestamp must be greater than zero"
        );
        require(
            block.timestamp > _loanDefaultedTimestamp,
            "Loan defaulted timestamp must be in the past"
        );

        uint256 secondsSinceDefaulted = block.timestamp -
            _loanDefaultedTimestamp;
 
        int256 incentiveMultiplier = int256(86400) -
            int256(secondsSinceDefaulted);

        if (incentiveMultiplier < -10000) {
            incentiveMultiplier = -10000;
        }

        amountDifference_ =
            (int256(_amountOwed) * incentiveMultiplier) /
            int256(10000);
    }
```

If the loan is not liquidated a bit later than 24 hours, liquidator doesn't even need to pay anything to claim the rewards, and the same applies when the borrower is the liquidator. In return, the liquidator can get borrower's collateral, and if the liquidator is the borrower, he can get back his collaterals, as well as having his default loan resolved at low, or even no costs.

## Impact
A malicious borrower can exploit this to have his loan resolved at lower cost, also getting his collaterals back.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive(
        uint256 _bidId,
        int256 _tokenAmountDifference
    ) public bidIsActiveForGroup(_bidId) {
        uint256 amountDue = getAmountOwedForBid(_bidId, false);

        uint256 loanDefaultedTimeStamp = ITellerV2(TELLER_V2)
            .getLoanDefaultTimestamp(_bidId);

        int256 minAmountDifference = getMinimumAmountDifferenceToCloseDefaultedLoan(
                amountDue,
                loanDefaultedTimeStamp
            );

        require(
            _tokenAmountDifference >= minAmountDifference,
            "Insufficient tokenAmountDifference"
        );

        if (_tokenAmountDifference > 0) {
            //this is used when the collateral value is higher than the principal (rare)
            //the loan will be completely made whole and our contract gets extra funds too
            uint256 tokensToTakeFromSender = abs(_tokenAmountDifference);

            IERC20(principalToken).transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amountDue + tokensToTakeFromSender
            );

            tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations += int256(tokensToTakeFromSender);

            totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += amountDue;
        } else {
           
            uint256 tokensToGiveToSender = abs(_tokenAmountDifference);

            IERC20(principalToken).transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amountDue - tokensToGiveToSender
            );

            tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations -= int256(tokensToGiveToSender);

            totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += amountDue;
        }

        //this will give collateral to the caller
        ITellerV2(TELLER_V2).lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient(_bidId, msg.sender);
    }
```
