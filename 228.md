## Vulnerability Detail
Inside [TellerV2.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol), In function [_repayLoan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L851-L898) at line [L866-867](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L866-L867) there is check that 
if `paymentAmount >= _owedAmount` then  `paymentAmount = _owedAmount` but later on the payment which is transferred to lender or send to escrowVault by function `_sendOrEscrowFunds` is the same Payment struct with payments amount (principal + interest) irrespective of whether paymentAmount > owedAmount or not.
## Impact
