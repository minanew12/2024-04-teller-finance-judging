# Inadequate Minimum TWAP Interval Configuration Leads to Potential Price Volatility

## Summary
The initialization function of the contract allows setting a twapInterval without enforcing a minimum threshold. This oversight could lead to the use of too short an interval for TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) calculations, resulting in volatile and less reliable price data.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract's initialize function accepts a twapInterval parameter intended to specify the duration over which average prices are calculated to mitigate short-term price fluctuations. Without a lower bound on this value, users could set an impractically short interval that fails to smooth out price volatility effectively.

## Impact
Using an inadequately short TWAP interval could result in several undesirable outcomes:

- Increased Price Volatility: Short intervals may not average out the rapid fluctuations typical in crypto markets, leading to unstable price feeds.
- Market Manipulation Risks: Shorter intervals can be more susceptible to price manipulation, as manipulators need only influence the market price briefly to affect the TWAP calculation.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability and ensure the reliability of TWAP calculations, the following measures should be implemented:

- Minimum TWAP Interval Enforcement: Introduce a check to ensure that the twapInterval is set to a minimum acceptable value. This can prevent setting intervals that are too short to be effective.
`require(_twapInterval >= minimumTwapInterval, "TWAP interval too short");
`
