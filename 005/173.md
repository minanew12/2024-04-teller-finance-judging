# get sqrt twap price will be incorrect if tick become negative

## Summary
Twap price will be larger than it should be when ticks diff become negative and if
       ` int24(
                    (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) /
                        int32(twapInterval)
                )  ! = 0`
## Vulnerability Detail
[uniswap implementation for handling negative ticks ](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/697c2474757ea89fec12a4e6db16a574fe259610/contracts/libraries/OracleLibrary.sol#L36)
However protocol didn't decrease the tick when ticks diff become negative and if  ` int24(
                    (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) /
                        int32(twapInterval)
                )  ! = 0`
## Impact
price will be bigger than it should be
