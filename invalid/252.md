# The owner of the `LenderGroup_Smart` contract can maliciously deploy a non-lending pool or set an unfair interest rate.

## Summary
When deploying a pool because the max cap of `_interestRateLowerBound` and `_interestRateUpperBound` in the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#initialize()` function is not specified, a pool that cannot be loaned can be deployed or an unfair interest rate can be set.
## Vulnerability Detail
LenderGroup_Smart contract is a `pool` for lending principal tokens.
This pool is deployed one for each token pair so that one poolShareToken is deployed for each token pair in Uniswap.
```solidity
    function _deployPoolSharesToken()
        internal
        onlyInitializing
        returns (address poolSharesToken_)
    {
      
221:    require(
            address(poolSharesToken) == address(0),
            "Pool shares already deployed"
        );


227:    (string memory name, string memory symbol ) = _generateTokenNameAndSymbol(
228:        address(principalToken),
229:        address(collateralToken)
230:    );

232:    poolSharesToken = new LenderCommitmentGroupShares(
            name,
            symbol,
            18  
        );

        return address(poolSharesToken);
    }
```
And all parameters cannot be changed after they are set in the `initialize()` function because there are no functions that set the value of parameters.
```solidity
    function initialize(
        address _principalTokenAddress,
        address _collateralTokenAddress,
        uint256 _marketId,
        uint32 _maxLoanDuration,
        uint16 _interestRateLowerBound,
        uint16 _interestRateUpperBound,
        uint16 _liquidityThresholdPercent, // When 100% , the entire pool can be drawn for lending.  When 80%, only 80% of the pool can be drawn for lending. 
        uint16 _collateralRatio, //the required overcollateralization ratio.  10000 is 1:1 baseline , typically this is above 10000
        uint24 _uniswapPoolFee,
        uint32 _twapInterval
    ) external initializer returns (address poolSharesToken_) {
        SNIP...

        maxLoanDuration = _maxLoanDuration;
197:    interestRateLowerBound = _interestRateLowerBound;
198:    interestRateUpperBound = _interestRateUpperBound;


        
        
203:    require(interestRateLowerBound <= interestRateUpperBound, "invalid _interestRateLowerBound");

        SNIP...
    }
```
However, as you can see, the max cap of `interestRateLowerBound` and `interestRateUpperBound` is not checked, but only the condition of #L203 is checked.
Therefore, a malicious distributor can set these two variables to `type(uint16).max` to disable lending or intentionally set them high to receive unfair interest.
1.If these two variables are set to `type(uint16).max`, the borrower can only set `APR` to `type(uint16).max`.
In this case, DOS occurs due to overflow of the `V2Calculations.sol#calculatePaymentCycleAmount()` function, and therefore the borrower cannot execute the `submitBid()` function.

V2Calculations.sol#calculatePaymentCycleAmount():
```solidity
    _principal.percent(_apr).percent(
        uint256(_paymentCycle).ratioOf(daysInYear, 10),
        10
    );

```
```solidity
    function percent(uint256 self, uint256 percentage, uint256 decimals)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return (self * percentage) / percentFactor(decimals);
    }
```
As you can see, the decimal of ERC20 tokens is greater than 6, DOS is occured in the `percent()` function due to overflow.

2.The deployer can also set these two variables arbitrarily, so he can set an unfair interest rate.
## Impact
The owner of the `LenderGroup_Smart` contract can maliciously deploy a non-lending pool or set an unfair interest rate.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the following line to the `initialize()` function.
```solidity
    require(interestRateUpperBound <= maxRate, "interest rate is too big.");
```
