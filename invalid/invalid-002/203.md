# There is no minAmount protection in the addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup and burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings functions

## Summary
From the README file:
`We chose to ignore MEV in the lender group contract for now as it was too difficult to design out and because other pools such as Uniswap exist with MEV.`  
However, Uniswap has the `minAmountOut` parameter in its functions, which protects the user from potential token loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
The value of shares changes over time. If the protocol is functioning properly and the borrower repays loans, the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` smart contract receives interest, and the price of the share increases. Additionally, the price of the share can decrease if a liquidator liquidates a defaulted loan in certain cases.


To ensure that the user does not receive fewer shares than expected during `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup` and fewer principal tokens when burning their shares (`burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings`), protection arguments need to be added to both functions:
```solidity
function addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(
        uint256 _amount,
        address _sharesRecipient
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesAmount_) {
    
function burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings(
        uint256 _amountPoolSharesTokens,
        address _recipient
    ) external returns (uint256) {    
```

## Impact
The user receives fewer shares during `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup` or fewer principal tokens when burning shares (`burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings`) if the share price changes just before the execution of both functions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing checks as follows:
```diff
function addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(
        uint256 _amount,
+        uint256 _minAmountShares,
        address _sharesRecipient
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesAmount_) {
        //transfers the primary principal token from msg.sender into this contract escrow

        principalToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        sharesAmount_ = _valueOfUnderlying(_amount, sharesExchangeRate());

+        require(sharesAmount_ >= _minAmountShares, "Revert");

        totalPrincipalTokensCommitted += _amount;
        //principalTokensCommittedByLender[msg.sender] += _amount;

        //mint shares equal to _amount and give them to the shares recipient !!!
        poolSharesToken.mint(_sharesRecipient, sharesAmount_);
    }
    
 function burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings(
        uint256 _amountPoolSharesTokens,
+        uint256 _minPrincipalTokens,
        address _recipient
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        poolSharesToken.burn(msg.sender, _amountPoolSharesTokens);

        uint256 principalTokenValueToWithdraw = _valueOfUnderlying(
            _amountPoolSharesTokens,
            sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        );

+        require(principalTokenValueToWithdraw >= _minPrincipalTokens, "Revert");

        totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn += principalTokenValueToWithdraw;

        principalToken.transfer(_recipient, principalTokenValueToWithdraw);

        return principalTokenValueToWithdraw;
    }   
```
