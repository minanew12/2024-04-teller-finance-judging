# Initializing a commitment will not be possible due to a wrong target address used

## Summary
Initializing a commitment will not be possible due to a wrong target address used.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol` contract, there is the `initialize()` function which is supposed to set initial values for the commitment. One of the things the function does is to approve a market forwarder using this piece of code:
```solidity
ITellerV2Context(TELLER_V2).approveMarketForwarder(
            _marketId,
            SMART_COMMITMENT_FORWARDER
        );
```
However, the issue arises because the `approveMarketForwarder()` function is on the `TellerV2Context` contract but it uses the `TELLER_V2` address. Such a function is not available on the `TellerV2` contract and that will lead to a revert.
## Impact
High as initializing a commitment will not be possible.
