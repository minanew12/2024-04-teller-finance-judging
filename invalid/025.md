# If borrower is late for their payment, lender can re-enter via the `repayLoanCallback` and still liquidate their loan

## Summary
If borrower is late for their payment, lender can re-enter via the `repayLoanCallback` and still liquidate their loan

## Vulnerability Detail
Within `_repayLoan`, first the funds are sent and then state changes are made
```solidity
        _sendOrEscrowFunds(_bidId, _payment); //send or escrow the funds // @audit - this calls repayLoanCallback

        // update our mappings
        bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.principal += _payment.principal;
        bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.interest += _payment.interest;
        bid.loanDetails.lastRepaidTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
```
After loans are `defaulted`, borrowers can still make late repayments and get them back in healthy position. The problem is that the lender can set a malicious loan listener contract, such that when the lender repays, the listener contracts calls either `lenderCloseLoan` or liquidates it. This way the borrower repayment will still go through and the lender will still take all funds

## Impact
Theft of funds from the borrower/ unfair liquidation.
