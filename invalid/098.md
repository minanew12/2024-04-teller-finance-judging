# Malicious miners can gain the majority of interest of `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` through a sandwich attack.

## Summary

There are no restrictions on depositing and withdrawing, such as a cooldown period, making sandwich attacks highly likely.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's consider the following scenario: 
1. `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` has $10,000. 
2. Alice wants to repay $100 in interest.
3. Bob, a malicious miner, executes two transactions before and after Alice's transaction as follows: 
    - Before Alice's transaction: Bob deposits $90,000. 
    - After Alice's transaction: Bob withdraws all his shares. 
In Bob's first transaction, he owns `90,000 / (10,000 + 90,000) = 9/10` of the total supply, and total assets become `$(10,000 + 90,000) = $100,000`. During Alice's transaction, total assets become `$(100,000 + 100) = $100,100`. In Bob's last transaction, he takes `$100,100 * 9 / 10 = $90,090`, resulting in a `$90` profit. 
The malicious miner Bob can include multiple repayment transactions to increase his profit.

## Impact

Malicious miners can gain the majority of interest of `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` through a sandwich attack.
