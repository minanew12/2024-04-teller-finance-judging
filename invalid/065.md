# Lender manager cannot mint NFTs

## Summary
[claimLoanNFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L578) won't mint NFTs to users.

## Vulnerability Detail
When [claimLoanNFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L578) is called, it will execute [lenderManager::registerLoan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L593), which in turn should mint an NFT. However, the lender manager currently has the `onlyOwner` modifier on its [registerLoan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderManager.sol#L40) function, preventing anyone from calling it, including Teller. This is because the LenderManager is deployed separately, and its owner will not be TellerV2.

```solidity
    function registerLoan(uint256 _bidId, address _newLender)
        public
        override
        onlyOwner
    {
        _safeMint(_newLender, _bidId, "");
    }
```
Thus [claimLoanNFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L578) will revert every time it's called.
## Impact
A core contract function is not working.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function registerLoan(uint256 _bidId, address _newLender)
        public
        override
        onlyOwner
    {
        _safeMint(_newLender, _bidId, "");
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either deploy the manager or modify the initialization function as follows:

```diff
-   function __LenderManager_init() internal onlyInitializing {
+   function __LenderManager_init(address tellerV2) internal onlyInitializing {
        __Ownable_init();
        __ERC721_init("TellerLoan", "TLN");
+       transferOwnership(tellerV2);
    }
```
