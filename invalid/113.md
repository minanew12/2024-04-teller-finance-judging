# Sequencer going down will cause damage even though Teller does not bridge

## Summary
The developers advise not to focus on Sequencer bugs, stating they are not implementing a bridge. However, if the sequencer goes down, the auctions executing on [LenderCommitmentGroup](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol) (LCG) will not close, reaching the bottom point (100% collateral for 0% principal), causing LPs to lose profits and potentially some of their stake.

## Vulnerability Detail
Despite the developers mentioning in the README that we shouldn't focus on Sequencer bugs, it's important to note that if the Sequencer goes down, not only bridging will be affected.

> "For now, assume the sequencer will not misbehave or go offline. Our protocol does not directly deal with bridging."

Currently, LCG uses an auctioning mechanism to liquidate its loans. The auctions return 100% of the collateral, with only the principal changing from `T=0 at 800%` principal to `T=1 day for 100%` and finally to `T=1 day + ~3hours for 0% principal`.

If the sequencer goes down, some of the current actions would reach the `T=1 day + 3 hours` time before being liquidated. Only a few hours of downtime would be enough, as the point where the auction goes from 100% principal to 0% principal lasts less than 3 hours. This will push an auction's value downwards, causing unfair liquidation prices, decreasing LP profits, and potentially reducing their stakes (principal).

## Impact
LPs losing funds. Auctions (core functionality) are disrupted and will expire.

## Code Snippet
[Auction math](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L512-L519) - notice how it only takes 10k seconds to go from 100% principal to 0% principal.
```solidity
uint256 secondsSinceDefaulted = block.timestamp - _loanDefaultedTimestamp;

int256 incentiveMultiplier = int256(86400) - int256(secondsSinceDefaulted);

if (incentiveMultiplier < -10000) {
    incentiveMultiplier = -10000;
}
```

## Recommendation
I suggest implementing checks for the sequencer, although with the current setup, it may not be the best solution. Another possibility is to provide more time for the negative auction (1 day). Sequencers usually don't go down for more than a few hours, so this will limit losses.
