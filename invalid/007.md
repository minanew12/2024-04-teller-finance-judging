# abi.encodePacked with Dynamic Types : Potential Hash Collision in Token Name and Symbol Generation

## Summary
A potential issue was identified in the function _generateTokenNameAndSymbol. This function uses abi.encodePacked() to concatenate strings to generate a token name and symbol. The use of abi.encodePacked() with multiple dynamic type arguments can lead to hash collisions, which is a significant concern in the context of smart contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the use of abi.encodePacked() with dynamic type arguments. abi.encodePacked() is a low-level function that concatenates its arguments without padding, which can lead to unintended collisions when encoding multiple dynamic types. This is particularly problematic in the context of generating unique identifiers or keys, such as token names and symbols, where collisions can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is moderate to high, depending on the specific use case of the smart contract. If the generated token names or symbols are used as unique identifiers or keys in the contract's logic, hash collisions could lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect token allocations or unauthorized access to funds. In the worst-case scenario, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the contract's behavior or access funds they should not have access to.

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to replace the use of **abi.encodePacked()** with **abi.encode()** in the lines where the token name and symbol are generated. **_abi.encode()_** is a safer alternative as it includes padding for dynamic types, reducing the risk of hash collisions. Here's the recommended modification:
