# Lender can gas grief loan repayments/liquidations.

## Summary
When a loan is repaid(partially or fully) or liquidated tokens are send either to the lender himself or an escrow contract. Also the protocol has added a feature so any lender can add a listener when a repayment happens. However both of these calls(token transfer and callback to listener) have specified gas which a malicious lender can use to gas grief other users.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is maxed gas set when transferring tokens to the lender(100000). If this fails, tokens will be send to escrow. After that, if a lender has added address to `repaymentListenerForBid` mapping, a call to the address will be executed with max gas of 80000. This listener can be added by calling `setRepaymentListenerForBid`.

Consider a scenario in which a borrower pays his loan in 10 parts. However the lender is malicious and uses all possible gas in both calls.

## Impact
Borrowers/Liquidators having to pay big gas fees.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
            bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.transferFrom{ gas: 100000 }(
                _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
                lender,
                _paymentAmount
            )
```

```solidity
                ILoanRepaymentListener(loanRepaymentListener).repayLoanCallback{
                    gas: 80000
                }( //limit gas costs to prevent lender griefing repayments
                    _bidId,
                    _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
                    _payment.principal,
                    _payment.interest
                )

```solidity
    function setRepaymentListenerForBid(uint256 _bidId, address _listener)
        external
    {
        address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bids[_bidId].marketplaceId);

        require(
            sender == bids[_bidId].lender,
            "Only bid lender may set repayment listener"
        );

        repaymentListenerForBid[_bidId] = _listener;
    }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add parameter to the function that will allow users to specify how much gas they want to spend on these calls.
