# Incorrect `getSqrtTwapX96` may be obtained due to unsafe downcasts

## Summary
When calculating `sqrtPriceX96` in `getSqrtTwapX96()`, an unsafe downcast from `uint32` to `int32` 
may occur and silently overflow, leading to the value of `sqrtPriceX96` being obtained incorrectly .
## Vulnerability Detail
- Take a look at [LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart#getSqrtTwapX96()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L570-L595)
```solidity
572:    function getSqrtTwapX96(uint32 twapInterval)

---SNIP

588            sqrtPriceX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(
589                int24(
590                    (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) /
591                        int32(twapInterval) ----------------> unsafe downcast from uint32 to int32
592                )
```
- As we can see the value of `twapInterval` is `uint32` [0, 4,294,967,295], because an unsafe downcast from `uint32` to `int32` [-2,147,483,648, 2,147,483,647] may occur and silently overflow, leading to the value of `sqrtPriceX96` being obtained incorrectly.
## Impact
If overflow occurs in function `getSqrtTwapX96()`, the calculated value of `sqrtPriceX96` will be a totally different value than what should really be, which could cause a huge impact on the calculation the value of `requiredCollateral` by using the function `getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount()` .

## Recommendation
Consider change to :
```diff
            sqrtPriceX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(
                int24(
                    (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) /
---                     int32(twapInterval)
+++                     int56(uint56(twapInterval))
                )
```
