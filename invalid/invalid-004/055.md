# "getCollateralTokenType" check includes "NONE"  type as valid

## Summary
"getCollateralTokenType" check includes "NONE"  type as valid, which will lead to no collateral for the loan.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside "acceptCommitmentWithRecipient" function there is "getCollateralTokenType" parameter requirement to be less than the ordinal of "CommitmentCollateralType.ERC1155_ANY_ID" and there is "CommitmentCollateralType.NONE" at index 0 making it valid, which will lead to "NONE" collateral type being valid type, so loan lender will receive no collateral.

## Impact
High since it might lead to no collateral for the loan.
