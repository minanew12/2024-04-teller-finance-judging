# Borrower can give more collateral than he should and get it locked as well as possible lose it

## Summary
Borrower can give more collateral than he should and get it locked as well as possible lose it due to the protocol taking all of the provided collateral instead of just the required.
## Vulnerability Detail
A borrower can immediately take out a loan under pre-set conditions using the `acceptCommitmentWithRecipient()` function. He has to input the commitment he is targeting that has those pre-set conditions as well as some other values such as `_principalAmount` and `_collateralAmount`. Let's assume he is trying to borrow an ERC20 token and is giving such in return. There is this if check in the internal `_acceptCommitment()` function:
```solidity
if (commitmentCollateralTokenType != CommitmentCollateralType.NONE) {
            createLoanArgs.collateral = new Collateral[](1);
            createLoanArgs.collateral[0] = Collateral({
                _collateralType: _getEscrowCollateralType(commitmentCollateralTokenType), // Some kind of standardization
                _tokenId: _collateralTokenId,
                _amount: _collateralAmount,
                _collateralAddress: _collateralTokenAddress // commitment.collateralTokenAddress
            });
        }
```
If the `commitmentCollateralTokenType` is not `NONE` (it's ERC20 in our case), then we add a `Collateral` struct to the `createLoanArgs`.

Then, we call `_submitBidWithCollateral()` which calls the `submitBid()` function on the `TellerV2` contract (the one with the `Collateral` function argument).
```solidity
bidId = _submitBidWithCollateral(createLoanArgs, _msgSender());
```
That function commits the input collateral (committing here means that the collateral is in a way scheduled for taking but hasn't been taken yet):
```solidity
bool validation = collateralManager.commitCollateral(
            bidId_,
            _collateralInfo
        );
```
If everything goes well (borrower has as much collateral as he has specified and some other conditions), the `validation` variable will be true which passes the `require` statement on the next line. Then, back to `_acceptCommitment()`, we call this function:
```solidity
_commitment.acceptFundsForAcceptBid(
            _msgSender(), //borrower
            bidId,
            _principalAmount,
            _collateralAmount,
            _collateralTokenAddress,
            _collateralTokenId,
            _loanDuration,
            _interestRate
        );
```
This function checks whether the borrower passes the pre-set conditions (e.g., has provided enough collateral for the principal, has specified a high enough interest rate). One of the checks it does is whether the collateral is enough:
```solidity
        uint256 requiredCollateral = getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount(
            _principalAmount
        );

        require(
            (_collateralAmount * STANDARD_EXPANSION_FACTOR) >=
                requiredCollateral,
            "Insufficient Borrower Collateral"
        );
```
It then does a few more things and calls `TellerV2::lenderAcceptBid()` to accept the bid as all of the conditions have passed. There, one of the main things that happen are the collateral being sent to an escrow contract using the committed collateral and the principal being set to the borrower.
```solidity
        // Tell the collateral manager to deploy the escrow and pull funds from the borrower if applicable
        collateralManager.deployAndDeposit(_bidId);
```
```solidity
        //transfer funds to borrower
        if (amountToBorrower > 0) {
            bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
                sender,
                bid.receiver,
                amountToBorrower
            );
        }
```

The issue arises because the collateral the borrower specified might be more than required. It is very common and expected that if a borrower provides more collateral than required, he will get the extra amount back. A borrower might provide more collateral in a lot of different cases, he might have not checked the exact amount he is required to send or there might have been a quick change in the market making his specified collateral worth more than the specified principal.

The borrower will not be able to take out his extra collateral until he has paid off the loan leaving the funds locked for a while. Even worse, if he can not pay off the loan for some reason, his collateral will be taken and he will lose more than he should have.
## Impact
Borrower can give more collateral than he should and get it locked as well as possible lose it

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only take the amount that is required, not the whole amount he specified. Another option would be to calculate the principal amount based on the collateral he provided or vice versa.
