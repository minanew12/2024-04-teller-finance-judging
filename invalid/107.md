# `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` should also liquidate in case the collateral drops significantly in value or risk insolvency

## Summary

`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` only liquidates based on the borrower missing payments, but the collateral value may drop sharply and if the debt is not repayed within a short period of time, `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` may become insolvent.

## Vulnerability Detail

[LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart::liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L422) goes through in case [block.timestamp > _loanDefaultedTimestamp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L502), which is fetched from [TellerV2::getLoanDefaultTimestamp()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L429), consisting of allowing liquidation if the borrower missed the payment and a `defaultDuration` has [passed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L1245).

However, consider the scenario that a certain collateral is going to zero in a week and the default date is only in a week. The protocol would watch the collateral value go to `0` without being able to take any action. If there was a threshold such that it would be possible for the loan to be liquidated, the debt could be repayed before the collateral value reached `0` and LPs would not lose their deposits.

## Impact

`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` insolvency and lost of funds for the LPs if the collateral goes to zero quickly.

## Recommendation

Implement a separate liquidation method to handle the case when the collateral drops sharply in value within a short period.
