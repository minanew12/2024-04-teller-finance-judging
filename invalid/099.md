# No event emit during `TellerV2._sendOrEscrowFunds()`.

## Summary

`TellerV2._sendOrEscrowFunds()` doesn't emit any event for lenders to aware of that they have been repayed.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `TellerV2._sendOrEscrowFunds()`, if the transferring lending token to the lender at `L911` fails, tokens are depositted into `escrowVault`. However, since there is no event emit, lenders don't aware of that they are repayed through `escrowVault`.

```solidity
    function _sendOrEscrowFunds(uint256 _bidId, Payment memory _payment)
        internal
    {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];
        address lender = getLoanLender(_bidId);

        uint256 _paymentAmount = _payment.principal + _payment.interest;

        try 

911         bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.transferFrom{ gas: 100000 }(
                _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
                lender,
                _paymentAmount
            )
        {} catch {
            address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);

            uint256 balanceBefore = bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.balanceOf(
                address(this)
            ); 

            //if unable, pay to escrow
            bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
                sender,
                address(this),
                _paymentAmount
            );

            uint256 balanceAfter = bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.balanceOf(
                address(this)
            );

            //used for fee-on-send tokens
            uint256 paymentAmountReceived = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;

            bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.approve(
                address(escrowVault),
                paymentAmountReceived
            );

            IEscrowVault(escrowVault).deposit(
                lender,
                address(bid.loanDetails.lendingToken),
                paymentAmountReceived
            );
        }

        address loanRepaymentListener = repaymentListenerForBid[_bidId];

        if (loanRepaymentListener != address(0)) {
            try
                ILoanRepaymentListener(loanRepaymentListener).repayLoanCallback{
                    gas: 80000
                }( //limit gas costs to prevent lender griefing repayments
                    _bidId,
                    _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
                    _payment.principal,
                    _payment.interest
                )
            {} catch {}
        }
    }
```

## Impact

Lenders could think that they were not repayed.
