# Incorrect calculation of the required collateral amount for borrowing. `baseAmount.percent(collateralRatio)`

## Summary

In the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`, the collateralRatio is the overcollateralization ratio, and a user can borrow `collateralAmount * collateralRatio` in principal tokens. However, the required collateral amount is calculated incorrectly in the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The amount of required collateral for a `baseAmount` of principal tokens should be `baseAmount / collateralRatio`. However, in the following code, the required collateral amount is calculated as `baseAmount` * `collateralRatio`, which is incorrect.

```solidity

    uint16 public collateralRatio; //the overcollateralization ratio, typically 80 pct

    function getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount(uint256 _principalAmount)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 baseAmount = _calculateCollateralTokensAmountEquivalentToPrincipalTokens(
                _principalAmount
            );

        //this is an amount of collateral
@>      return baseAmount.percent(collateralRatio);
    }
```

```solidity

    function percent(uint256 self, uint16 percentage)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return percent(self, percentage, 2);
    }

    function percent(uint256 self, uint256 percentage, uint256 decimals)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return (self * percentage) / percentFactor(decimals);
    }

```

As a result, the calculated amount of required collateral is less than the actually required amount.

## Impact

The comment says that the typical collateralRatio is 80 pct. It means that borrowers can borrow 1.25 times as worthy as his own collateral. This leads to 20 pct loss of fund for liquidity providers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The calculation of the required collateral amount should be corrected.

```diff

    function getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount(uint256 _principalAmount)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 baseAmount = _calculateCollateralTokensAmountEquivalentToPrincipalTokens(
                _principalAmount
            );

        //this is an amount of collateral
-       return baseAmount.percent(collateralRatio);
+       return baseAmount * 10000 / collateralRatio;
    }

```
