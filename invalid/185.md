# TellerV2.sol#lenderAcceptBid() - Marketplace fee recipient can be address(0), resulting in a DoS of the function

## Summary
TellerV2.sol#lenderAcceptBid() - Marketplace fee recipient can be address(0), resulting in a DoS of the function

## Vulnerability Detail
When a lender wants to accept a bit, he calls `lenderAcceptBid`.

When a bid is accepted some parts of the principal go to the marketplace fee recipient.

```solidity
 //transfer fee to marketplace
        if (amountToMarketplace > 0) {
            bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
                sender,
             marketRegistry.getMarketFeeRecipient(bid.marketplaceId),
                amountToMarketplace
            );
        }
```

If we take a look at `getMarketFeeRecipient` we can see that if `feeRecipient == address(0)`, then the market owner will be returned as a fee recipient, but the market owner can also be address(0).

```solidity
function getMarketFeeRecipient(uint256 _marketId)
        public
        view
        override
        returns (address)
    {
        address recipient = markets[_marketId].feeRecipient;

        if (recipient == address(0)) {
            return _getMarketOwner(_marketId);
        }

        return recipient;
    }
```

Note that `ledenderAcceptBid` uses `isMarketClosed`, which only checks if the market is closed, not that it doesn't have an owner.
```solidity
/**
     * @notice Returns the status of a market being open or closed for new bids. Does not indicate whether or not a market exists.
     * @param _marketId The market ID for the market to check.
     */
    function isMarketClosed(uint256 _marketId)
        public
        view
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        return marketIsClosed[_marketId];
    }
```

This implies that the function is fine with a lender accepting a bid whose market owner is `address(0)`, which can be problematic as shown in this issue.

## Impact
Complete DoS on accepting bids that use the marketplace.

Note that there are tokens that allow token transfers where the to address is address(0), in those cases the marketplace fee will be gone forever.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rework the marketplace fee sending logic to

```solidity
if (amountToMarketplace > 0 ) {
            if (marketRegistry.getMarketFeeRecipient(bid.marketplaceId) != address(0))
            {
                bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
                    sender,
                    marketRegistry.getMarketFeeRecipient(bid.marketplaceId),
                    amountToMarketplace
                );
            }
            else {
                bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
                    sender,
                    owner()
                    amountToMarketplace
                );
            }
        }
```

This way the function can always execute and if the market fee recipient is address(0), the fee will just go to the protocol, which is a lot better than being lost.
