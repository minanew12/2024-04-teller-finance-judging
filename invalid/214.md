# Uniqueness Violation in Market ID Assignment During Contract Initialization

## Summary
The initialization function of the contract allows setting a marketId without checking its uniqueness. This oversight could lead to potential conflicts or overwrites in market configurations if the same marketId is reused inadvertently.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract's initialize function accepts a marketId parameter intended to uniquely identify a market configuration. However, there is no mechanism in place to verify whether the marketId has been previously set. As a result, it's possible to set up multiple markets with the same ID, leading to data integrity issues and unpredictable contract behavior.

## Impact
If multiple market configurations use the same marketId, it could result in several undesirable outcomes:

- Data Overwrite: New market configurations could unintentionally overwrite existing configurations.

- Operational Confusion: Users and administrative functions might operate on incorrect market data, leading to errors in transaction processing or market management.

- Security Risks: Reuse of market IDs could be exploited by malicious actors aware of the issue, potentially manipulating market operations or extracting unauthorized benefits.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability and prevent potential issues associated with non-unique marketIds, implement one or more of the following measures:

- Uniqueness Check: Introduce a check to ensure that each marketId can only be used once. This could involve maintaining a mapping of used IDs and checking against it during initialization.
`require(!marketExists[_marketId], "Market ID already exists");
marketExists[_marketId] = true;`

- ID Generation: Consider implementing a system for automatic marketId generation to ensure uniqueness, such as using a sequential counter or a hash of relevant parameters.
