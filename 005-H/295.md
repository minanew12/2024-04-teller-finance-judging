# There is No way to get the Loan ownership back

## Summary
The Protocol allow the Lenders to mint NFT for transferring the Loan ,after minting NFT the `bid.lender` get changed to `LENDER_MANAGER`. however if Lender don't want to transfer the NFT and get back the ownership from lender manger, there is no way to do this.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Alice minted the NFT for her Loan.
2. The bid.lender got changed to "LENDER_MANGER"
3. Alice want to get back the `bid.lender` to her address
4. She can't , because there is no feature to handle this case.

## Impact
The NFT minting can result in lose of direct ownership for loan . which will prevent Alice form performing certain action like the one defined in my previous submission.
