# After Claiming NFT the lender will not be able to close Loan

## Summary
The Protocol support that the loan ownership can be transfer, to achieve this feature they provided solution to mint NFT against `BidId` of that loan and set the `USING_LENDER_MANAGER` as a lender. the issue is the owner of loan is not be able to close the loan if its get defaulted and there is no way to get the ownership back from `USING_LENDER_MANAGER`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Alice (Lender) accept the bid after some time he relise that he shulod transfer the ownership of loan to Bob, for this he minted the NFT. so upon minting the NFT the protocol mint the nft to Bob and set the `USING_LENDER_MANAGER` as `bid.lender` :
```solidity
function claimLoanNFT(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "claimLoanNFT")
        whenNotPaused
    {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
        require(sender == bid.lender, "only lender can claim NFT");

        // set lender address to the lender manager so we know to check the owner of the NFT for the true lender
      @>  bid.lender = address(USING_LENDER_MANAGER); // @audit : lender address updated

        // mint an NFT with the lender manager
        lenderManager.registerLoan(_bidId, sender);
    }
```
Bob receive the NFT after some time the Loan get Defaulted so now the Bob wants to Close the loan and get back the assets locked.
here Bob should call `lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient` or `CloseLoan` function in both of cases  `_lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient` this function get called: 
```solidity
    function _lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient(
        uint256 _bidId,
        address _collateralRecipient
    ) internal acceptedLoan(_bidId, "lenderClaimCollateral") {
        require(isLoanDefaulted(_bidId), "Loan must be defaulted.");

        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];
        bid.state = BidState.CLOSED;

        address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
        @>  require(sender == bid.lender, "only lender can close loan"); // @audit : claim NFT will also effect this
        collateralManager.lenderClaimCollateral(_bidId);

        emit LoanClosed(_bidId);
    }

```
As the lender is already changed so the Bob can not close the  loan.
#### POC
```solidity
function test_revert_claim_loan_nft_close_loan() public {
        // @audit : nft owner can be replicated 
        uint256 bidId = 1;
        setMockBid(bidId);

        tellerV2.setLenderManagerSuper(address(lenderManagerMock));

        tellerV2.mock_setBidState(bidId, BidState.ACCEPTED);

        tellerV2.setMockMsgSenderForMarket(address(lender));
        vm.prank(address(lender));

        tellerV2.claimLoanNFT(bidId);
        address owener1 = lenderManagerMock.ownerOf(1);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 100 days);
        vm.prank(address(lender));
        vm.expectRevert();
        tellerV2.lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient(bidId, address(this));
        //assert
    }
```
add this to `tests/TellerV2/TellerV2Bid.sol` file and run with command : `forge test --mt test_revert_claim_loan_nft_close_loan -vvv`

## Impact
After Claiming NFT the Lender can not perform Close Loan Operation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use `getLoanLender()` to get the owner of NFT if minted the require check should be like follow :
```solidity
        require(sender == bid.lender || sender == getLoanLender(bidId) , "only lender can close loan"); // @audit : claim NFT will also effect this

```
