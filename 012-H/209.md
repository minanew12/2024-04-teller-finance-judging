# LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart can be tricked to account for not owned loans payments

## Summary

Any lender can set `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` as callback receiver in `setRepaymentListenerForBid` and break its internal accounting.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `_repayLoan`, callback is made to user controlled listener.

```solidity
address loanRepaymentListener = repaymentListenerForBid[_bidId]; // set by lender
if (loanRepaymentListener != address(0)) {
    try
        ILoanRepaymentListener(loanRepaymentListener).repayLoanCallback{
            gas: 80000
        }(
            _bidId,
            _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
            _payment.principal,
            _payment.interest
        )
    {} catch {}
}
```

`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` use this callback for internal accounting, but can be tricked to account for not owned loans.


```solidity
function repayLoanCallback(
    uint256 _bidId,
    address repayer,
    uint256 principalAmount,
    uint256 interestAmount
) external onlyTellerV2 {
    totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += principalAmount;
    totalInterestCollected += interestAmount;
}
```



## Impact

`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` internal accounting for `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` and `totalInterestCollected` is broken which can cause underflow in `getTotalPrincipalTokensOutstandingInActiveLoans()` and inflate `getPoolTotalEstimatedValue()`
