# `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol` inherits ownable upgradable but its never initialized

## Summary
ownable upgradable isn't initialized in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol`. it won't be possible to pauseBorrowing/unpauseBorrowing in the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
ownable upgradable isn't initialized in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol`.

Its `__Ownable_init()` is supposed to be called in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.initialize()`

Since ownable upgradable isn't initialized in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol` contract, the contract probably doesn't have an owner so its `pauseBorrowing()` and `unpauseBorrowing()` functions are uncallable due to the onlyOwner modifier on them.
```solidity
 function pauseBorrowing() public virtual onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
        _pause();
    }

```

```solidity
    function unpauseBorrowing() public virtual onlyOwner whenPaused {
        _unpause();
    }
```


## Impact
ownable upgradable isn't initialized in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol`. owner won't be able to pauseBorrowing/unpauseBorrowing in the contract.
