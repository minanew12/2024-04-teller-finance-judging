# Possible Division by Zero vulnerability

## Summary
Division by zero is a logic or input error that usually results in an exception and software termination. This information can be important to an attacker, as it indicates that a variable was zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the _valueOfUnderlying function, specifically in the line where a division operation is performed. The division uses the rate variable as the divisor. If the rate is zero, this operation will cause the transaction to revert due to a division by zero error.

## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to unexpected contract behavior, potentially causing transactions to fail when they should not. It could also be exploited by malicious actors to halt the contract's operations by providing a zero value for rate.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it's crucial to ensure that rate is never zero before performing the division. This can be achieved by adding a require statement at the beginning of the function to check that rate is greater than zero. Here's the modified function:
