# Owner can still front-run users and increase the fee to profit

## Summary
The README states that the owner, although trusted, should not be able to steal funds from users or interfere with loans. However, this is not the case.

## Vulnerability Detail
As mentioned in the README, the following line clearly states that the owner should not be able to steal fees from users:

> They should not be able to steal funds or interfere with loans in other ways.

However, the owner still has the ability to change the protocol fee whenever they want using [setProtocolFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/ProtocolFee.sol#L44-L51). This could allow the owner to front-run [lenderAcceptBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L481), increasing the fee and stealing some of the borrower's principal.

## Impact
Loss of funds.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function setProtocolFee(uint16 newFee) public virtual onlyOwner {
    if (newFee == _protocolFee) return;

    uint16 oldFee = _protocolFee;
    _protocolFee = newFee;
    emit ProtocolFeeSet(newFee, oldFee);
}
```

## Recommendation
