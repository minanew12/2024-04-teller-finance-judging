# Rewards in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` is sandwichable.

## Summary
An attacker can steal the lender's hard-earned rewards by sandwiching the repay function call with the deposit and withdraw. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Depositors/lenders in the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` get interest rewards whenever there is a loan repayment or liquidation. The reward is calculated based on the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Shares` they hold, If an individual holds more shares then they will get more rewards. 

An attacker can take advantage of this and monitor the `repay` transaction in mempool. He can front-run the `repay` and deposit huge sums of money in the pool getting the majority of shares, he can then back-run the `repay` transaction with the withdraw function claiming the majority rewards without being loyal to the system.
## Impact
An attacker can steal the rewards from the loyal users, which can force the users to leave the platform because of low rewards.

## Recommendation
One solution for this would be to introduce a lockup period for deposits. Depositors can be forced to lock the tokens for at least 1 day.
