# lender will lose funds due to address collision

## Summary
lender will lose repayment funds from borrower cause of the address collision .
## Vulnerability Detail

         address constant USING_LENDER_MANAGER =
             0x84D409EeD89F6558fE3646397146232665788bF8;


         function claimLoanNFT(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "claimLoanNFT")
        whenNotPaused
    {
        // Retrieve bid
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
        require(sender == bid.lender, "only lender can claim NFT");

        // set lender address to the lender manager so we know to check the owner of the NFT for the true lender
        bid.lender = address(USING_LENDER_MANAGER);

        // mint an NFT with the lender manager
        lenderManager.registerLoan(_bidId, sender);
    }


Protocol implement that if the lender claim the loan nft , protocol set the lender of bid to USING_LENDER_MANAGER address  to make sure he claimed the loan nft and cannot claim that loan nft again . However protocol is planning to deploy on that contract at any other chains . At the chains that allow for create 2 opcode , it's feasible to compute that USING_LENDER_MANAGER with create 2 . So there will be address collisions at any other chains . 





        function getLoanLender(uint256 _bidId)
        public
        view
        returns (address lender_)
    {
        lender_ = bids[_bidId].lender;

        if (lender_ == address(USING_LENDER_MANAGER)) {
            return lenderManager.ownerOf(_bidId);
        }

        //this is left in for backwards compatibility only
        if (lender_ == address(lenderManager)) {
            return lenderManager.ownerOf(_bidId);
        }
    }

GetLoanLender is called to retrieve the lender of bid for repayment from borrowers .In that getLoanLender , if lender of bid is same to address using lender manger , lender address will be nft owner of bid (protocol assume that lender already mint the loan nft , actually that is not and due to address collision , lender will be same to using lender manger address and will retrieve the owner of nft . There is no nft owner for that bid and will retrieve address 0 ) .

## Impact
lender address will be zero and funds will be lost .

## Recommendation
pls implement for new way of setting loan nft is claimed
