# `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` does not use `mulDiv` when converting between token and share amounts, possibly leading to DoS or loss of funds

## Summary

`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` calculates the exchange rate and `_valueOfUnderlying()` without using `mulDiv` from `OpenZeppelin`, which might make it overflow, leading to DoS and possible loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

`sharesExchangeRate()` is calculated as 
```solidity
rate_ =
            (poolTotalEstimatedValue  *
                EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) /
            poolSharesToken.totalSupply();`
```
which overflows if `poolTotalEstimatedValue > (2^256 - 1) / 1e36`. The readme mentions that any `ERC20` token that is supported by a Uniswap pool is supported, which means that if a token has decimals of, for example, `1e36`, the calculation above may easily overflow. In this case, `rate_ = realPoolTotalEstimatedValue * 1e36 * 1e36 = realPoolTotalEstimatedValue * 1e72`, where `realPoolTotalEstimatedValue` is the number of tokens without the decimals part. Thus, the number of tokens needed to overflow would be `(2^256 - 1) / 1e72 = 115792`, which at a price of $1 is just `115792 USD`.

This bug is also present in `_valueOfUnderlying()`, which returns `value_ = (amount * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) / rate;`.

## Impact

DoS of `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`, possibly with stuck tokens if users call `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup()` with smaller amount at a time that do not cause an overflow when calculating `sharesExchangeRate()` and `_valueOfUnderlying()`, but would overflow when withdrawing in the calculation of `sharesExchangeRate()`, as `poolTotalEstimatedValue` could have increased to the value that overflows.

## Recommendation

Use `Math::mulDiv` from [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol).
