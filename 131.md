# NFTs will be bricked on repay

## Summary
ERC721 can be used as principal without any issues, as long as its `paymentCycle == _duration`, as we need to repay it only once. However, if [_sendOrEscrowFunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L901) enters its `catch`, the NFT will be deposited into the **EscrowVault**, but it would not be withdrawable, as [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/EscrowVault.sol#L43-L48) uses `safeTransfer`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside TellerV2, we can use ERC721 as principal, such as putting some collateral to loan an NFT for a few days or a week. These NFTs can be repaid or liquidated without an issue. The only thing we need to keep in mind is that `paymentCycle == _duration`, in order to generate only 1 repayment.

However, an issue appears when [_sendOrEscrowFunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L916-L947) reverts in its `try` and enters its `catch` statement. The token is approved and then [deposited](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/EscrowVault.sol#L32-L41) into **EscrowVault** using `safeTransferFrom`. However, when we try to [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/EscrowVault.sol#L43-L48) our NFT, the TX reverts, as we are using [safeTransfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/EscrowVault.sol#L47).

## Impact
Lenders will lose their NFTs if the initial `transferFrom` reverts.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function withdraw(address token, uint256 amount) external {
    address account = _msgSender();

    balances[account][token] -= amount;
    ERC20(token).safeTransfer(account, amount);
}
```

## Recommendation
Change the [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/EscrowVault.sol#L43-L48) function to use `safeTransferFrom`.
