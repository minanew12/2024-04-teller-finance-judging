# Users can take undercollateralized borrows, as contract falsely assumes `requiredCollateral` is scaled up by 1e18

## Summary
Users can take undercollateralized borrows, as contract falsely assumes `requiredCollateral` is scaled up by 1e18

## Vulnerability Detail
When taking a borrow in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol`, the `requiredCollateral` is dynamically calculated based on the price principal token's price.

It's done so in one of the following two functions: 
```solidity
    function token0ToToken1(uint256 amountToken0, uint256 priceToken1PerToken0)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return
            MathUpgradeable.mulDiv(
                amountToken0,
                UNISWAP_EXPANSION_FACTOR,
                priceToken1PerToken0,
                MathUpgradeable.Rounding.Up
            );
    }

    //note: the price is still expanded by UNISWAP_EXPANSION_FACTOR
    function token1ToToken0(uint256 amountToken1, uint256 priceToken1PerToken0)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return
            MathUpgradeable.mulDiv(
                amountToken1,
                priceToken1PerToken0,
                UNISWAP_EXPANSION_FACTOR,
                MathUpgradeable.Rounding.Up
            );
    }
```

The problem is that when checking if the user's inputted collateral is enough, it multiplies it by 1e18 as it assumes `requiredCollateral` is also scaled up by 1e18, when in reality it isn't. 

```solidity
        //this is expanded by 10**18
        uint256 requiredCollateral = getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount(
            _principalAmount
        );

        require(
            (_collateralAmount * STANDARD_EXPANSION_FACTOR) >=
                requiredCollateral,
            "Insufficient Borrower Collateral"
        );
```

This would allow for taking borrows against dust amounts of liquidity, allowing to pretty much drain the contract.

## Impact
Taking borrows against dust collateral, draining the contract.

Do not multiply `_collateralAmount ` by 1e18
