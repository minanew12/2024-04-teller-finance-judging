# `LenderCommitGroup_Smart::acceptFundsForAcceptBid` will not revert if insufficient collateral is provided

## Summary
`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` is a contract that acts as it's own loan committment, which has liquidity pools with `principal token` and `collateral token`. Users can deposit `principal tokens` in exchange for `share tokens`.

Due to an issue regarding decimal precision, the check to ensure borrower has specified sufficient amount of collateral will always pass, allowing them to borrow far more than they should for the amount of collateral specified.

## Vulnerability Detail
`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart::acceptFundsForAcceptBid` [#L336](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L336)
```javascript
   function acceptFundsForAcceptBid(
        address _borrower,
        uint256 _bidId,
        uint256 _principalAmount,
        uint256 _collateralAmount,
        address _collateralTokenAddress,
        uint256 _collateralTokenId,
        uint32 _loanDuration,
        uint16 _interestRate
    ) external onlySmartCommitmentForwarder whenNotPaused {
        require(
            _collateralTokenAddress == address(collateralToken),
            "Mismatching collateral token"
        );
        
        .
        .
        .

        //this is expanded by 10**18
@>      uint256 requiredCollateral = getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount(
            _principalAmount
        );

@>      require(
            (_collateralAmount * STANDARD_EXPANSION_FACTOR) >=
                requiredCollateral,
            "Insufficient Borrower Collateral"
        );
    }
```

If we follow the flow of `getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount`, we see the following:

```javascript
    //this result is expanded by UNISWAP_EXPANSION_FACTOR
    function _getUniswapV3TokenPairPrice(
        uint32 _twapInterval
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        // represents the square root of the price of token1 in terms of token0

        uint160 sqrtPriceX96 = getSqrtTwapX96(_twapInterval);

@>      //this output is the price ratio expanded by 1e18
        return _getPriceFromSqrtX96(sqrtPriceX96);
    }
```

Dev comments implicate that the assumption is that the output of the ratio is expanded by 1e18.  However, this is not the case:

```javascript
    //this result is expanded by UNISWAP_EXPANSION_FACTOR
    function _getPriceFromSqrtX96(
        uint160 _sqrtPriceX96
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 price_) {
        uint256 priceX96 = (uint256(_sqrtPriceX96) * uint256(_sqrtPriceX96)) /
            (2 ** 96);

        // sqrtPrice is in X96 format so we scale it down to get the price
        // Also note that this price is a relative price between the two tokens in the pool
        // It's not a USD price
        price_ = priceX96;
    }
```

We can see that there is no expanding by 1e18. Now, looking back at `acceptFundsForAcceptBid()`:

`requiredCollateral` is the amount of collateral that the borrower must provide for the amount of principal they would like to borrow. The dev comments suggest that the amount is expanded by 1e18, but that is not true, It simply represents the amount of collateral token (i.e, amount * 10**18). 

Lets say the collateral is WETH, which has 18 decimals. The `_collateralAmount` parameter will be in 18 decimals already, but here we multiply by `STANDARD_EXPANSION_FACTOR` which is equal to 1e18. This will expand the decimals that will far exceed the decimals of `requiredCollateral`, therefore always passing the `require` check.

Lets say Bob specifies 1 WETH for `_collateralAmount` => `_collateralAmount = 1e18`.
`requiredCollateral` is 5 WETH => `requiredCollateral = 5e18`

`_collateralAmount` * `STANDARD_EXPANSION_FACTOR` = 1e18 * 1e18 = 1e36 > 5e18.

Here, where the collateral specified is far less than amount required, passed the check, allowing Bob to borrow much more tokens for little collateral.

## Impact
Borrower users can borrow far more than they should be able to for the amount of collateral provided. Lender users suffer.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the `STANDARD_EXPANSION_FACTOR` from the multiplication or expand by 1e18 as intended.
