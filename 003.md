# Market owner can frontrun bids with unfavorable updates to loan parameters

## Summary

A user creates a bid for a loan using `TellerV2.submitBid()`. During its execution, several parameters for the loan are fetched from the `MarketRegistry` contract. The parameters can be updated at any time by the market owner, a restricted role. The market owner can update the market registry with unfavorable parameters by frontrunning any bid submissions and accepting the loan immediately. Users have no protection against such an attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
Specifically, the market owner can frontrun a `submitBid()` transaction and update the following loan parameters:

- paymentCycle
- paymentDefaultDuration
- bidExpirationTime
- paymentType

```solidity
        (bid.terms.paymentCycle, bidPaymentCycleType[bidId]) = marketRegistry
            .getPaymentCycle(_marketplaceId);


        ...


        bidDefaultDuration[bidId] = marketRegistry.getPaymentDefaultDuration(
            _marketplaceId
        );


        bidExpirationTime[bidId] = marketRegistry.getBidExpirationTime(
            _marketplaceId
        );


        bid.paymentType = marketRegistry.getPaymentType(_marketplaceId);
```

## Impact
- Users have no control over loan terms as they can be updated prior to `submitBid()` transaction confirmation.
