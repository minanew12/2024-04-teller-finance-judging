# Shares Withdrawn Can Round In Favor Of User

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The principal tokens to withdraw during share burning is determined by  `value_ = (amount * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) / rate` where `rate` is determined by `sharesRateInverse()`

`sharesRateInverse()` rounds _down_. Since this is the _denominator_ so when calculating the principal tokens out, the token amount actually can rounds _up_

This means that the user gets more tokens than they should when withdrawing leading to insolvency.

## Impact

The asset to share ratio can become inflated either due to a share inflation via liquidation, and/or through accumulated rounding difference through adding principal and withdrawing shares. This can cause the gain from exploiting the round-in-favor of user to exceed the gas costs of minting and burning shares. Furthermore, even with just a small loss, the last share withdrawer cannot withdraw via `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings()` as it will attempt to transfer out more tokens than are available due to the rounding direction.
