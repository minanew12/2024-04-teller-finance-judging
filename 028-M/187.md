# sharesExchangeRateInverse has to be rounding up

## Summary
wrong rounding direction at sharesExchangeRateInverse
## Vulnerability Detail
sharesExchangeRateInverse is used to calcualate the value of underlying for burning the shares and withdraw the earnings.


        function sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        public
        view
        virtual
        returns (uint256 rate_)
    {
        return
        
        //*@audit-info -------->>> round up 
            (EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) /
            sharesExchangeRate();
    }


In calculating the share exchange rate inverse , result is rounding down .

             uint256 principalTokenValueToWithdraw = _valueOfUnderlying(
            _amountPoolSharesTokens,
            sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        );

with that exchange rate inverse , principal token value is calculate to withdraw .

         function _valueOfUnderlying(uint256 amount, uint256 rate)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256 value_)
    {
        if (rate == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        value_ = (amount * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) / rate;
    }

Due to the rounding down the exchange rate inverse , which may cause the rate less than i should be , And cause of lesser value is divided by , result value will be bigger than it should be . principalTokenValueToWithdraw will be bigger than it should be eventually .Protocol implement the rounding in the favor of protocol , not in the favor of user .Otherwise protocol gonna get drained by looping the mint and burn .
## Impact
Protocol gonna get drained due to the wrong rounding direction

Manual Review

## Recommendation
while calculating the exchange rate inverse , pls rounding up instead of rounding down
