# Fee-on-transfer Token & Non revert on failure token could broke logic and result in a DoS of `FlashRolloverLoan_G5::rolloverWithFlashLoan`

## Summary
`FlashRolloverLoan_G5::rolloverWithFlashLoan` accepts additional funds from the user as part of a transaction to close an old loan with a flash loan and open a new one. However, when [transferring a user's funds to a contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/FlashRolloverLoan_G5.sol#L110), it does not verify how much of the funds actually reached the contract. And it also doesn't use safeTransferFrom, which opens up the additional possibility of missing an error in no-revert on failure tokens. Lack of user tokens may result in the transaction not having enough funds to pay the flash loan fees. Also the amount of funds received from the user is considered when calculating the funds remaining on the contract, if the contract has received less than expected, this can ruin the correctness of the calculations (getting more than what is actually left) and lead to a revert when sending funds a few lines below. Thus, the function will not be available for such tokens, as the actual remaining quantity will always be less than the expected quantity, causing the entire transaction to revert

```solidity
 uint256 fundsRemaining = acceptCommitmentAmount +
            _rolloverArgs.borrowerAmount -
            repaymentAmount -
            _flashFees;

        if (fundsRemaining > 0) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(_flashToken).transfer(
                _rolloverArgs.borrower,
                fundsRemaining
            );
        }
```
## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens take a transfer fee (e.g. STA, PAXG), some do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future (e.g. USDT, USDC). Also Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead return false (e.g. [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code), [EURS](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdb25f211ab05b1c97d595516f45794528a807ad8#code)).

If there are approved loans in such tokens on the platform, this could lead to the problems described above

## Impact
Since there are very few such tokens, likelihood is low, but it breaks the protocol functionality and can lead to DoS so total score: medium
## Code Snippet
```solidity
 if (_borrowerAmount > 0) {
            IERC20(lendingToken).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
                _borrowerAmount
            );
        }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use safeTransferFrom, and control the amount received by the contract as well, as is done in the same function below.
