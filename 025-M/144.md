# Anyone can bypass the borrowing limitation of `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`.

## Summary

Anyone can manipulate the value of `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.getPrincipalAmountAvailableToBorrow()` at will by squeezing deposits and withdrawals before and after the borrowing.

## Vulnerability Detail

`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.getPrincipalAmountAvailableToBorrow()` is calculated based on `getPoolTotalEstimatedValue()`.

```solidity
    function getPrincipalAmountAvailableToBorrow()
        public
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {     

            return  ( uint256( getPoolTotalEstimatedValue() )).percent(liquidityThresholdPercent) -
            getTotalPrincipalTokensOutstandingInActiveLoans() ;
     
    }
```

However, before borrowing, anybody can intentionally heighten the `getPoolTotalEstimatedValue()` by depositing. Then they can borrow more than allowed before depositing. After borrowing, they can withdraw their assets, and incur no loss.

## Impact

Anyone can borrow all assets of `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` bypassing the borrowing limitation.
