# A user can borrow liquidity, even though `getPrincipalAmountAvailableToBorrow() < 0`.

## Summary

Borrowing is prevented when the percentage of lent amount relative to the `poolTotalEstimatedValue` is greater than the `liquidityThresholdPercent`. However, this restriction can be circumvented, as users are still able to borrow liquidity even in this case.

## Vulnerability Detail


The `getPrincipalAmountAvailableToBorrow()` function prevents borrowing when the percentage of lent amount relative to the `poolTotalEstimatedValue` is greater than the `liquidityThresholdPercent`.

```solidity

    function getPrincipalAmountAvailableToBorrow()
        public
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {     

            return  ( uint256( getPoolTotalEstimatedValue() )).percent(liquidityThresholdPercent) -
            getTotalPrincipalTokensOutstandingInActiveLoans() ;
     
    }

```

Consider the following scenario:
1. Alice deposit so many principle token into the pool that `getPrincipalAmountAvailableToBorrow() == balanceOf(address(this))`.
2. Alice borrows liquidity as much as possible.
3. Alice withdraw all liquidity.

After the above scenario, all priciple tokens are lended, nothing left in the pool.

## Impact

A user can borrow liquidity, even though `getPrincipalAmountAvailableToBorrow() < 0`. This may delay the withdraw time of liquidity providers.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The interest rate mechanism should be improved. Additionally, there should be some time duration between deposit and withdrawal.
