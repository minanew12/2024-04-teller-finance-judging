# `LendderCommitmentGroup::_calculateCollateralTokensAmountEq` may be manipulated

## Summary
`LendderCommitmentGroup::_calculateCollateralTokensAmountEq` may be manipulated

## Vulnerability Detail
`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` plays role of a lender, who accepts users bids made trough `SmartCommitmentForwarder`. There are params, which are being set (such as `maxLoanDuration`, `minInterestRate` and `collateralRatio`). User bids should comply with those  "lender terms". One such is `collateralRatio`. The system uses uniswapV3 pool pair to calculate the price of the collateral token based the principal token. System uses combination of uniswap `twap` and `slot0` approach to obtain the "worst case" value for collateral token. But the problem is that the following function should swap `Math.min` and `Math.max` operations, because currently user has incentive to easily manipulate uniswap pool using flash loan, so his collateral is being valued more than it actually is, which will make it possible for him to borrow greater amount of the principal token. In the worst case, he would be able to borrow way more than his collateral.

```solidity
        if (principalTokenIsToken0) {
            //token 1 to token 0 ?
            uint256 worstCasePairPrice = Math.min(
                pairPriceWithTwap,
                pairPriceImmediate
            );

            collateralTokensAmountToMatchValue = token1ToToken0(
                principalTokenAmountValue,
                worstCasePairPrice //if this is lower, collateral tokens amt will be higher
            );
        } else {
            //token 0 to token 1 ?
            uint256 worstCasePairPrice = Math.max(
                pairPriceWithTwap,
                pairPriceImmediate
            );

            // 320820836.68038327

            collateralTokensAmountToMatchValue = token0ToToken1(
                principalTokenAmountValue,
                worstCasePairPrice //if this is lower, collateral tokens amt will be higher
            );
        }
```
The problem is big, because protocol may work with any uniswap pool pair, which means that those with low liquidity are easy to be significantly manipulated

## PoC

Lets imagine the following scenario.
For simplicity we will use famous uniswapV3 pair - USDC/WETH (USDC is token0)
- We have `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` with `principalToken = WETH` and `collateralToken = USDC`
- At time of writing `sqrtPX96 = 1375453771508111342738045916077552` (1 WETH = 3318 USDC)
- Bob wants to borrow 1 WETH so lets examine how the collateral USDC for 1 WETH is calculated:

```solidity
uint256 requiredCollateral = getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount(
            _principalAmount
        );
```
Inside [_calculateCollateralTokensAmountEquivalentToPrincipalTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L610) we get twap and slot 0 prices and execute the following on them 
```solidity
   uint256 priceX96 = (uint256(_sqrtPriceX96) * uint256(_sqrtPriceX96)) /
            (2**96);
```
In our case, where  `sqrtPX96 = 1375453771508111342738045916077552`, `priceX96` would be `23878795336383985532501659788439041092`
        -  we enter [_getCollateralTokensAmountEquivalentToPrincipalTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L634-L640). Principal token is WETH, which is token1, so we enter the following branch:
```solidity
 else {
            //token 0 to token 1 ?
            uint256 worstCasePairPrice = Math.max(
                pairPriceWithTwap,
                pairPriceImmediate
            );

            // 320820836.68038327

            collateralTokensAmountToMatchValue = token0ToToken1(
                principalTokenAmountValue,
                worstCasePairPrice //if this is lower, collateral tokens amt will be higher
            );
        }
```
- Lets `worstCasePairPrice` is `max` of  `pairPriceWithTwap` and `pairPriceImmediate(slot0)` (for now we continue with 23878795336383985532501659788439041092)
           - Using the above [token0ToToken1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L666-L678) function will return `3317929627` (3317.929627 - The real value of USDC tokens
- Now lets see what would happen if malicious Bob make a flashloan valued million of dollars, so by swapping large amount of WETH for USDC (he is increasing `sqrtPX96` of the pool)
- Lets imagine liquidity and his flash loan are enough to make new  `sqrtPX96 =  2075453771508111342738045916077552`,
- So `priceX96 = 54368399076423291366357940158517940885` which is more than the real value and one returned from twap        (`1375453771508111342738045916077552`)
- This means that the manipulated value would be taken into calculations here:
```solidity
     uint256 worstCasePairPrice = Math.max(
                pairPriceWithTwap,
                pairPriceImmediate
            );
```
- With this value 1 WETH would be valued at `1457246559 (1472.246559)` (more than 2 times cheaper than the real value)
- So if we have a collateral ratio of 120%, we would get the value of `1766,6958708` USDC as required collateral to borrow 1 WETH (which in reallity is worth 3318 USDC)
- In this state, expoiter has received `3318 - 1766 = 1Â 552` dollars for free and has no incentive to repay his loan, which results in loss of depositors in `LenderCommitmentGroup` contract
- All this happens in a single transaction and Bob successfully return the flashloan to Aave or any other provider, which supports flash-loans

## Impact
Users can game the price logic in their favor, effectively getting a loan at a massive discount.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
`_getCollateralTokensAmountEquivalentToPrincipalTokens` function should look as follows:
```solidity
    function _getCollateralTokensAmountEquivalentToPrincipalTokens(
        uint256 principalTokenAmountValue,
        uint256 pairPriceWithTwap, // Price of token 0 in terms of token 1 (in token 0 decimals)
        uint256 pairPriceImmediate,
        bool principalTokenIsToken0
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 collateralTokensAmountToMatchValue) {
        if (principalTokenIsToken0) {
            //token 1 to token 0 ?
-            uint256 worstCasePairPrice = Math.min(
+            uint256 worstCasePairPrice = Math.max(
                pairPriceWithTwap,
                pairPriceImmediate
            );

            collateralTokensAmountToMatchValue = token1ToToken0(
                principalTokenAmountValue,
                worstCasePairPrice //if this is lower, collateral tokens amt will be higher
            );
        } else {
            //token 0 to token 1 ?
+            uint256 worstCasePairPrice = Math.min(
-            uint256 worstCasePairPrice = Math.max(
                pairPriceWithTwap,
                pairPriceImmediate
            );

            // 320820836.68038327

            collateralTokensAmountToMatchValue = token0ToToken1(
                principalTokenAmountValue,
                worstCasePairPrice //if this is lower, collateral tokens amt will be higher
            );
        }
    }
```
- By this expoiter won't be able to manipulate it in his favor.
