# M-4: Reentrancy Attack in liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive Function

## Summary
The `liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive` function in the contract exhibits a vulnerability that allows reentrancy attacks. Depending on the value of `_tokenAmountDifference`, the function either takes additional tokens from the sender (if positive) or returns tokens to the sender (if negative). However, the state changes occur after the token transfer, leaving the contract susceptible to reentrancy attacks.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises due to the improper ordering of operations within the `liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive` function. Specifically, the function performs a token transfer before updating state variables. Depending on the value of `_tokenAmountDifference`, the function either transfers tokens from the sender to the contract (if positive) or returns tokens to the sender (if negative). However, critical state changes, such as updating `tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations` and `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid`, occur after the token transfer. This creates a window of opportunity for reentrancy attacks, as the contract's state is not yet updated to reflect the token transfer when external calls are made.
## Impact
If exploited, an attacker could manipulate the contract's state or perform unauthorized actions during the reentrancy attack. This could lead to loss of funds, unexpected behavior, or manipulation of the liquidation process.

```solidity
  if (_tokenAmountDifference > 0) {
            //this is used when the collateral value is higher than the principal (rare)
            //the loan will be completely made whole and our contract gets extra funds too
            uint256 tokensToTakeFromSender = abs(_tokenAmountDifference);

            /// audit posible reentrancy
            IERC20(principalToken).transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amountDue + tokensToTakeFromSender
            );

            tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations += int256(tokensToTakeFromSender);

            totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += amountDue;
        } else {
            uint256 tokensToGiveToSender = abs(_tokenAmountDifference);

            /// audit posible reentrancy
            IERC20(principalToken).transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amountDue - tokensToGiveToSender
            );

            tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations -= int256(tokensToGiveToSender);

            totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += amountDue;
        }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern to ensure that state changes occur before interacting with external contracts or performing token transfers. Specifically, ensure that token transfers are the last action in the function to prevent reentrancy attacks. Consider using reentrancy guards or mutex locks to further mitigate the risk of reentrancy attacks.
