# `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` does not use `SafeERC20`, which could lead to DoS or permanently loss funds

## Summary

`LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` does not use `SafeERC20`, so any interaction with a token may fail, leading to DoS or loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some `ERC20` tokens do not return a bool on `transferFrom()`, `transfer()` or `approve()`. Solidity implements return data length checks, which means that any token that does not return a bool on a function will revert. 

## Impact

If the token reverts on `transferFrom()`, funds will not be lost but the contract would be in a DoS state. If `transferFrom()` works but `transfer()` fails, tokens would get stuck.
