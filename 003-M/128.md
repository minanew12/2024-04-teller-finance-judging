# Transfers/Approvals on some tokens that are meant to be integrated  would not work in protocol

## Summary

The issue highlights a vulnerability in the integration of ERC20 tokens, specifically with tokens like `USDT` _(which protocol plans on integrating)_, that do not return a value from their `approve`, `transfer`, and `transferFrom` functions. This behavior leads to transaction reverts and impacts core functionalities of the protocol, making them inaccessible, by causing all functions attempting token operations to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

First note that this has been stated in the readme: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/README.md#L12-L16


> ### Q: If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of <a href="https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weird tokens</a> you want to integrate?

> We are allowing any standard token that would be compatible with Uniswap V3 to work with our codebase, just as was the case for the original audit of TellerV2.sol . The tokens are assumed to be able to work with Uniswap V3 .

Considering this:

> ... just as was the case for the original audit of TellerV2.sol.

Now, from [this conversation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller-judging/issues/423#issuecomment-1535401214) in the original `TellerV2.sol` audit we can see that protocol **does want** to support `USDT` and finds any information on it being useful, i.e quoting them:
> Thank you for the feedback. I am now reading more about this and it looks like USDT does not follow the normal ERC20 specification. We do want to support USDT so this is useful information.

Now in multiple instance in scope, the integrated ERC20 token is attempted to be approved/transferred/transferFrommed, however all instances of this inherently calls the `approve/transfer/transferFrom()` defined in openzeppelin's `ERC20`, this can be hinted like from [this snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L84-L87) and other instances in scope, with the search commands below:

Now going to openzeppelin's ERC20's `approve/transfer/transferFrom()` implementation we can see them specified like this https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol#L41-L78

```rust
    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
    (...snip)
    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
    (...snip)
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
```

But see `L199, L340 & L344` from `USDT`'s contract https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code

We can see that the definition of the functions are

```rust
    function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public
(...snip)
    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public
(...snip)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value)
```

This will then lead to different opcodes compiled by the compiler: when checking the length of the return data, `usdt.approve/transfer/transferFrom()` requires the length of the return data to be 0, while `ERC20.approve/transfer/transferFrom()` requires the length of the return data to be 1. Therefore, the **tx always reverts**.

## Impact

> See L199, L340 & L344 from https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code

So if the token's `approve/transfer/transferFrom()` does not return a value, like [USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code#L199), then `ERC20(_token).approve/transfer/transferFrom` will revert.

This will then cause all functions attempting approvals, transferrals or transferFroms to all revert breaking core functionalities (making them in-accessible) accross protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider inheriting and using openzeppelin's `SafeERC20` instead, since the safe wrappers call this function on a low level and as such it would not lead to a revert, i.e apply the logic from TellerV2.sol https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L58

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";
//(...snip)
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;
```

### Additional Note

Preferably whenever integrating approvals of `USDT` ensure that the previous allowance is completely used up or first set the approvals to `0`.
