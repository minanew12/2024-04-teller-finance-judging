# Using transferFrom won’t work with some tokens

## Summary

Using ERC20’s transfer and transferFrom will lead to issues.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens (like USDT) don't correctly implement the EIP20 standard and their `transfer`/ `transferFrom` function return void instead of a success boolean. Calling these functions with the correct EIP20 function signatures will always revert. Moreover, the`transfer`/ `transferFrom` functions return a boolean value indicating success for tokens that don’t revert. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Impact

Medium. The contract won’t work with certain tokens (for example, USDT), and failed transfers of tokens will still be counted as correct transfers.

## Recommendation

Use the SafeERC20 to perform ERC20 token transfers, just like in the TellerV2 contract.
