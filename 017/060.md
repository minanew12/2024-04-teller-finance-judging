# Incorrect use of `bidId` can cause DOS.

## Summary
`LenderCommitmentForwarder_G2:_acceptCommitment` is using `bidId` to check for the principal token support by commitment but the bidId used here is never initialized. 
## Vulnerability Detail
`acceptCommitment` is a function used by the borrower to get the loan. The following internal function `_acceptCommitment` checks all the requirements.

```solidity
function _acceptCommitment(
        uint256 _commitmentId,
        uint256 _principalAmount,
        uint256 _collateralAmount,
        uint256 _collateralTokenId,
        address _collateralTokenAddress,
        address _recipient,
        uint16 _interestRate,
        uint32 _loanDuration
    ) internal returns (uint256 bidId) {
        Commitment storage commitment = commitments[_commitmentId];

        //make sure the commitment data adheres to required specifications and limits
        validateCommitment(commitment);

        //the collateral token of the commitment should be the same as the acceptor expects
        require(
            _collateralTokenAddress == commitment.collateralTokenAddress,
            "Mismatching collateral token"
        );
        //the interest rate must be at least as high has the commitment demands. The borrower can use a higher interest rate although that would not be beneficial to the borrower.
        require(
            _interestRate >= commitment.minInterestRate,
            "Invalid interest rate"
        );
        //the loan duration must be less than the commitment max loan duration. The lender who made the commitment expects the money to be returned before this window.
        require(
            _loanDuration <= commitment.maxDuration,
            "Invalid loan max duration"
        );
        //@audit-issue bidId is not initialized
->>>     require(
            commitmentPrincipalAccepted[bidId] <= commitment.maxPrincipal,
            "Invalid loan max principal"
        );
    }
```

As you can see the `bidId` is used here to check for the principal token of the commitment. The `bidId` is never intentionally initialized in this function but is a return value that is defaulted to 0 by solidity. So whenever anyone calls the `acceptCommitment` with a valid principal token this check will always reverts.
## Impact
This check will cause the function DOS for commitmentId > 0.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This was an unintentional typo by the developer, and the valid check is done in line 539. Removing the check with bidId would resolve the issue.
