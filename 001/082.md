# Lenders have the ability to manipulate any LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart contract using the repayLoanCallback()

## Summary
In the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` smart contract, the `repayLoanCallback` function will increase `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` and `totalInterestCollected` due to a malicious lender without receiving principal tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's consider the scenario:
`Prerequisite`: The `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` has users who deposit principal tokens.

1)The borrower calls `submitBid`, and the lender calls `lenderAcceptBid`.
2)The lender calls `setRepaymentListenerForBid(bidId, LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart)`, indicating `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` as the listener.
```solidity
function setRepaymentListenerForBid(
        uint256 _bidId,
        address _listener
    ) external {
        address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bids[_bidId].marketplaceId);

        require(
            sender == bids[_bidId].lender,
            "Only bid lender may set repayment listener"
        );

        repaymentListenerForBid[_bidId] = _listener;
    }
```
3)When the borrower calls `repayLoan` or the liquidator calls `liquidateLoanFull`, the internal `_sendOrEscrowFunds` function is invoked, which calls the `repayLoanCallback` function in the listener smart contract specified by the lender, in our case, the listener is `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`.
```solidity
function repayLoanCallback(
        uint256 _bidId,
        address repayer,
        uint256 principalAmount,
        uint256 interestAmount
    ) external onlyTellerV2 { //no proper validation
        //can use principal amt to increment amt paid back!! nice for math .
        totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += principalAmount;
        totalInterestCollected += interestAmount;
    }
```

In summary, it can be concluded that a lender with a different bid ID can call `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.repayLoanCallback`. The principal token of the lender could be completely different, with a higher number of decimals, leading to a potential Denial of Service (DOS) attack and an increase in interest without the transfer of principal tokens in the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` smart contract.

## Impact
Interest could increase (totalInterestCollected) without transferring principal tokens in the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` smart contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check within the `repayLoanCallback` function:
```diff
function repayLoanCallback(
        uint256 _bidId,
        address repayer,
        uint256 principalAmount,
        uint256 interestAmount
    ) external onlyTellerV2 {
+        require(
+           ITellerV2(TELLER_V2).getLoanLender(_bidId) == address(this),
+          "Wrong bid id"
+        );
        // need to check that lender for this bid id is current smart contract
        //can use principal amt to increment amt paid back!! nice for math .
        totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += principalAmount;
        totalInterestCollected += interestAmount;
    }
```
