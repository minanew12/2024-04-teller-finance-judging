# The return value of arbitrary ERC20 tokens transfers is not checked.

## Summary
The protocol doesnâ€™t check the return value of the `transfer` and `transferFrom` for arbitrary tokens which can lead to wrong accounting in protocol.  

## Vulnerability Detail

Some on the ERC20 implementation don't revert of transfer fail but they simply return false indicating the failure of the transfer. 

For these types of tokens, the contract calling them is responsible for checking the return value and making the necessary adjustments.

In `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup` the contract is not checking the return value on the transferFrom call from the user to the protocol, If the transfer fails it still accounts for that and mint use the share breaking the protocol accounting completely.

```solidity
function addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(
        uint256 _amount,
        address _sharesRecipient
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesAmount_) {
        //transfers the primary principal token from msg.sender into this contract escrow
        
   ->>  principalToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        sharesAmount_ = _valueOfUnderlying(_amount, sharesExchangeRate());

        totalPrincipalTokensCommitted += _amount;
        //principalTokensCommittedByLender[msg.sender] += _amount;

        //mint shares equal to _amount and give them to the shares recipient !!!
        poolSharesToken.mint(_sharesRecipient, sharesAmount_);
    }
```

This is just one example. But there are these issues all over the place where transfer and transferFrom is used.

## Impact
All the protocol accounting will break. eventually causing the DOS or loss of user funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use the safeERC20 library from openzeppelin to get rid of these issues.
