# `LenderCommitmentGroup_smart` does not  support Fee on Transfer tokens

## Summary
`addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup` doesn’t support fee on transfer tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol mentioned in the contest readme that it supports all the tokens supported by Uniswap v3 and Uniswap supports FOT tokens.

Here in `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup`, it is used by the lender to deposit the funds to the smart contract. If the FOT tokens are used, it doesn’t account for the fees because of which more shares will be minted to the user also the state variable `totalPrincipalTokensCommitted` is updated with the wrong amount.

```solidity
 function addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(
        uint256 _amount,
        address _sharesRecipient
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesAmount_) {
        //transfers the primary principal token from msg.sender into this contract escrow
        
        principalToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        sharesAmount_ = _valueOfUnderlying(_amount, sharesExchangeRate());

        totalPrincipalTokensCommitted += _amount;
        //principalTokensCommittedByLender[msg.sender] += _amount;

        //mint shares equal to _amount and give them to the shares recipient !!!
        poolSharesToken.mint(_sharesRecipient, sharesAmount_);
    }

```
## Impact
Incorrect accounting in the protocol will happen leading to unwanted  behavior.

## Recommendation
Add support for FOT tokens by checking the difference between before and after balance.
