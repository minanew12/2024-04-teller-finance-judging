# Some collateral will be locked in the contract

## Summary
Some tokens will be locked in the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` contract forever if used as principal token.
## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens, such as BNB, do not revert but return a bool value if the `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` function calls fail. Therefore, the transaction may not be reverted and funds may be lost.
```solidity
    function burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings(
        uint256 _amountPoolSharesTokens,
        address _recipient
    ) external returns (uint256) {
       

        
403:    poolSharesToken.burn(msg.sender, _amountPoolSharesTokens);

        uint256 principalTokenValueToWithdraw = _valueOfUnderlying(
            _amountPoolSharesTokens,
            sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        );

        totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn += principalTokenValueToWithdraw;

412:    principalToken.transfer(_recipient, principalTokenValueToWithdraw);

        return principalTokenValueToWithdraw;
    }
```
Even if token transmission fails in #L412, the `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings()` function is not reverted. Therefore, users may lose their `poolSharesToken`.
## Impact
If the token send fails, it will cause a lot of serious problems.
For example, if a token such as BNB is used as the principal token, the user may lose the `poolShareToken`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's `safeTransfer()`, which is able to handle the missing return value
