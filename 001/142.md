# Multiple contracts incompatible with USDT

## Summary
The protocol states `"We are allowing any standard token that would be compatible with Uniswap V3 to work with our codebase"`.

However, due to use of `IERC20Upgradeable.approve()` and `IERC20Upgradeable.transfer()` in `FlashRolloverLoan_G5`, and `IERC20.transferFrom` in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`, these contracts are incompatible with USDT. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The functions mentioned above all return a bool, however `USDT` on [mainnet](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code) does not. 

Function signatures don't match and therefore will revert.

## Impact
USDT incompatible with contracts mentioned above.
