# IERC20(token).approve revert if the underlying ERC20 token approve does not return boolean

## Summary

IERC20(token).approve revert if the underlying ERC20 token approve does not return boolean

## Vulnerability Detail

As stated in the README, the protocol currently supports any tokens compatible with Uniswap V3:
```markdown
We are allowing any standard token that would be compatible with Uniswap V3 to work with our codebase, just as was the case for the original audit of TellerV2.sol . The tokens are assumed to be able to work with Uniswap V3 .
```

However, USDT, a token compatible with Uniswap V3, deviates from this standard. Its `approve()` method doesn't have a return value, which will cause calls to `approve()` which is called throughout the codebase to revert because the OpenZeppelin IERC20 interface enforces the underlying token to return a boolean value.
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol#L67
 ```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
```

## Impact

USDT or other ERC20 token compatible with Uniswap V3 that does not return boolean for approve are not supported.
