# The function burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings() is subject to Re-entrancy Vulnerability

## Summary

In the contract LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol, the function `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings` transfers the funds before updating the state. This order of execution exposes the function, and subsequently the contract, to re-entrancy attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

In a re-entrancy attack, a malicious contract can call back into the vulnerable contract before the latter had a chance to finish its execution. 

## Impact

This potentially allows the attacker to drain funds from the contract.

```solidity
function burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings(
        uint256 _amountPoolSharesTokens,
        address _recipient
    ) external returns (uint256) {
       
        poolSharesToken.burn(msg.sender, _amountPoolSharesTokens);

        uint256 principalTokenValueToWithdraw = _valueOfUnderlying(
            _amountPoolSharesTokens,
            sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        );

        totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn += principalTokenValueToWithdraw;

        principalToken.transfer(_recipient, principalTokenValueToWithdraw);

        return principalTokenValueToWithdraw;
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent re-entrancy attack, the state should be updated before calling another contract and transferring any assets. Using the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern can mitigate this issue.
So the recommended change to the code is as follows:
```solidity
function burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings(
        uint256 _amountPoolSharesTokens,
        address _recipient
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        poolSharesToken.burn(msg.sender, _amountPoolSharesTokens);

        uint256 principalTokenValueToWithdraw = _valueOfUnderlying(
            _amountPoolSharesTokens,
            sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        );

        totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn += principalTokenValueToWithdraw;

        //Ensure the state (balance) is updated before transfer is made
        //This prevents re-entrancy attacks
        uint256 newBalance = totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn;

        require(
            newBalance <= address(this).balance, 
            "Insufficient balance in contract"
        );

        principalToken.transfer(_recipient, principalTokenValueToWithdraw);

        return newBalance;
    }
```
