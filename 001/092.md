# The protocol dosn't work well for USDT.

## Summary

Some tokens do not return bool on transfer, e.g. USDT on mainnet.

## Vulnerability Detail

USDT on mainnet do not return bool on transfer. But because of IERC20 interface, solidity will try to parse bool from nothing thus reverting.

So, for USDT, `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup()` will be reverted at [L313](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L313).

```solidity
    function addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(
        uint256 _amount,
        address _sharesRecipient
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesAmount_) {
        //transfers the primary principal token from msg.sender into this contract escrow
        
313     principalToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        sharesAmount_ = _valueOfUnderlying(_amount, sharesExchangeRate());

        totalPrincipalTokensCommitted += _amount;
        //principalTokensCommittedByLender[msg.sender] += _amount;

        //mint shares equal to _amount and give them to the shares recipient !!!
        poolSharesToken.mint(_sharesRecipient, sharesAmount_);
    }
```

This problem also occurs in several places.

## Impact

The protocol doesn't work well for USDT.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend using `SafeERC20` versions with the `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
