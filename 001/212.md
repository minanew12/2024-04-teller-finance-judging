# No sllippage protection in addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup and burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings

## Summary

No sllippage protection in addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup and burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings, which create great loss to users.

## Vulnerability Detail

Attackers can frontrun `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup` and `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings` to create bad rate for innocent users.

    function addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(
        uint256 _amount,
        address _sharesRecipient
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesAmount_) {
        //transfers the primary principal token from msg.sender into this contract escrow
        
        principalToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        sharesAmount_ = _valueOfUnderlying(_amount, sharesExchangeRate());

        totalPrincipalTokensCommitted += _amount;
        //principalTokensCommittedByLender[msg.sender] += _amount;

        //mint shares equal to _amount and give them to the shares recipient !!!
        poolSharesToken.mint(_sharesRecipient, sharesAmount_);
    }



    function burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings(
        uint256 _amountPoolSharesTokens,
        address _recipient
    ) external returns (uint256) {
       

        
        poolSharesToken.burn(msg.sender, _amountPoolSharesTokens);

        uint256 principalTokenValueToWithdraw = _valueOfUnderlying(
            _amountPoolSharesTokens,
            sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        );

        totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn += principalTokenValueToWithdraw;

        principalToken.transfer(_recipient, principalTokenValueToWithdraw);

        return principalTokenValueToWithdraw;
    }

## Impact

When a user `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup`, if the contract experiences a profit (through liquidation) while their transaction is pending (waiting in the mempool), they will receive fewer shares than they expected.

When a user `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings`, if the contract experiences a loss (through liquidation) while their transaction is pending (waiting in the mempool), they will receive fewer shares than they expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Both addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup/burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings functions should include slippage protection parameters provided by the users.
