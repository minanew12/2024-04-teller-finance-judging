# Front-running repayments to steal rewards from the protocol

## Summary

A malicious actor can front-run the repayment of a loan, thereby stealing rewards from the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` contract, acting as a lender, provides funds to borrowers. When a borrower's loan is repaid, the protocol calls `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.repayLoanCallback()` to increase the values of `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` and `totalInterestCollected`. 
```solidity
    function repayLoanCallback(
        uint256 _bidId,
        address repayer,
        uint256 principalAmount,
        uint256 interestAmount
    ) external onlyTellerV2 {
        //can use principal amt to increment amt paid back!! nice for math .
        totalPrincipalTokensRepaid += principalAmount;
        totalInterestCollected += interestAmount;
    }

```

The `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup()` function allows users to deposit principal tokens to receive shares, where `rate = poolTotalValue/totalSupply` and `shares = amount / rate`.

```solidity
function addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(
        uint256 _amount,
        address _sharesRecipient
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesAmount_) {
        //transfers the primary principal token from msg.sender into this contract escrow
        
        principalToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        sharesAmount_ = _valueOfUnderlying(_amount, sharesExchangeRate());

        totalPrincipalTokensCommitted += _amount;
        //principalTokensCommittedByLender[msg.sender] += _amount;

        //mint shares equal to _amount and give them to the shares recipient !!!
        poolSharesToken.mint(_sharesRecipient, sharesAmount_);
    }

```

 The `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings() ` function allows users to burn shares and withdraw assets, where `rate = poolTotalValue/totalSupply` and `sharesExchangeRateInverse = 1/rate`. The extracted asset `principalTokenValueToWithdraw = amount / sharesExchangeRateInverse`.
```solidity
 function burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings(
        uint256 _amountPoolSharesTokens,
        address _recipient
    ) external returns (uint256) {
       

        
        poolSharesToken.burn(msg.sender, _amountPoolSharesTokens);

        uint256 principalTokenValueToWithdraw = _valueOfUnderlying(
            _amountPoolSharesTokens,
            sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        );

        totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn += principalTokenValueToWithdraw;

        principalToken.transfer(_recipient, principalTokenValueToWithdraw);

        return principalTokenValueToWithdraw;
    }

```

The issue here is front-running `repayLoanCallback()`. When a malicious actor monitors transactions in the transaction pool and detects a loan repayment transaction being prepared, the bad actor executes `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup()` with higher gas to acquire shares preemptively. Then, after the repayment transaction is executed, the bad actor executes `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings()` to withdraw assets. Since `totalInterestCollected` increases during the loan repayment, `poolTotalValue` increases as well. As a result, `totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn` calculated in the `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings()` function is larger than expected, allowing the user to withdraw more assets.

## Impact
Stealing rewards from the protocol.
