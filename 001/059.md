# burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings causing more asset token withdrawal for users

## Summary
`burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings` is used for lenders to convert shares back into assets.
## Vulnerability Detail
The conversion has a rate utilize `poolSharesToken.totalSupply()`. The problem with the implementation is that LP tokens are burned before calculating withdrawal, leading to unfair withdrawal amounts.

```solidity
    function burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings(
        uint256 _amountPoolSharesTokens,
        address _recipient
    ) external returns (uint256) {
      
        //@audit-issue
        poolSharesToken.burn(msg.sender, _amountPoolSharesTokens);

        uint256 principalTokenValueToWithdraw = _valueOfUnderlying(
            _amountPoolSharesTokens,
            sharesExchangeRateInverse() //@audit returned lower, causing asset value to be HIGHER
        );
```
Within the `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings()` it utilizes the `sharesExchangeRate()`. Knowing that the totalSupply decreases first from the burn function. This means that the rate for `sharesExchangeRateInverse` will be lower, causing the return value from `_valueOfUnderlying` of tokens withdrawal to be higher.
```solidity
    function sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        public
        view
        virtual
        returns (uint256 rate_)
    {
        return

            (EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) /
            sharesExchangeRate(); // @audit rate_ returned is higher causing this function return value also to be LOWER
    }
    function sharesExchangeRate() public view virtual returns (uint256 rate_) {
         -- SNIP --
        rate_ =
            (poolTotalEstimatedValue  *
                EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) /
            poolSharesToken.totalSupply();  //@audit supply decreased, means rate_ will be higher
            }
```
## Impact
User will have higher amount of token asset withdrawn.

Run `forge test --match-test test_burn -vv`, if you want to check the error, change `assertNotEq` to `assertEq`
The test shows that a user withdraws half of 1e18 twice, and will noticed that 1e18 of tokens asset is returned.
```solidity
    function test_burn()
        public
    {
        principalToken.transfer(address(lenderCommitmentGroupSmart), 1e18);
        collateralToken.transfer(address(lenderCommitmentGroupSmart), 1e18);

        // @audit Removed to use Original ExchangeRate
        // lenderCommitmentGroupSmart.set_mockSharesExchangeRate(1e36 * 2);

        initialize_group_contract();

        //lenderCommitmentGroupSmart.set_totalPrincipalTokensCommitted(1000000);
        //lenderCommitmentGroupSmart.set_totalInterestCollected(2000000);

        vm.prank(address(lender));
        principalToken.approve(address(lenderCommitmentGroupSmart), 1e18);

        vm.prank(address(lender));
        //5e17
        uint256 sharesAmount_ = lenderCommitmentGroupSmart
            .addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(1e18, address(borrower));

        uint256 expectedSharesAmount = 1e18;

        assertEq(
            sharesAmount_,
            expectedSharesAmount,
            "Received an unexpected amount of shares"
        );
        vm.prank(address(borrower));
        uint expectedAssetAmount = 5e17;
        uint256 assetsAmount = lenderCommitmentGroupSmart.burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings(expectedAssetAmount,address(borrower));
                assertNotEq( // Returned not Equal
            assetsAmount,
            expectedAssetAmount,
            "Received an unexpected amount of shares"
        );
        vm.prank(address(borrower));
        uint expectedAssetAmount2 = 5e17;
        uint256 assetsAmount2 = lenderCommitmentGroupSmart.burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings(expectedAssetAmount,address(borrower));
                assertNotEq(// Returned not Equal
            assetsAmount2,
            expectedAssetAmount2,
            "Received an unexpected amount of shares2"
        );
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
    function burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings(
        uint256 _amountPoolSharesTokens,
        address _recipient
    ) external returns (uint256) {
      
        //@audit-issue
--        poolSharesToken.burn(msg.sender, _amountPoolSharesTokens);

        uint256 principalTokenValueToWithdraw = _valueOfUnderlying(
            _amountPoolSharesTokens,
            sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        );
++        poolSharesToken.burn(msg.sender, _amountPoolSharesTokens);
