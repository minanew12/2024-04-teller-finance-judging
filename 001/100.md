# M-1: Use `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` instead `transfer` and `transferFrom`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens (like USDT) don't correctly implement the EIP20 standard and their `transfer/ transferFrom` function return void instead of a success boolean. Calling these functions with the correct EIP20 function signatures will always revert. The `transferFrom()` method is used instead of `safeTransferFrom()`, which I assume is a gas-saving measure. I however argue that this isn’t recommended because:

[OpenZeppelin’s documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) discourages the use of `transferFrom()` use `safeTransferFrom()` whenever possible

## Impact
It is a good idea to add a require() statement that checks the return value of tokens transfers or to use something like OpenZeppelin’s `safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom()` unless one is sure the given token reverts in case of a failure. Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in contract.

However, using require() to check transfer return values could lead to issues with non-compliant ERC20 tokens which do not return a boolean value. Therefore, it's highly advised to use OpenZeppelin’s `safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom()`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
