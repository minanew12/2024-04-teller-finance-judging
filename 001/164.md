# The user could receive No `poolSharesToken` to claim his deposited tokens

## Summary
The amount of share token is calculated using current rate of exchange, However the exchange rate could be 0 which in result will return 0 amount and mint function does not revert on 0 amount minting.

## Vulnerability Detail
When user add new Principal Token the value of `poolSharesToken` is calculated using the following function:
```solidity
    function _valueOfUnderlying(uint256 amount, uint256 rate)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256 value_)
    {
        if (rate == 0) {
    @>        return 0;
        }

        value_ = (amount * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) / rate;
    }
``` 
The value of rate is calculated :
```solidity
function sharesExchangeRate() public view virtual returns (uint256 rate_) {
        

        uint256 poolTotalEstimatedValue = getPoolTotalEstimatedValue();

        if (poolSharesToken.totalSupply() == 0) {
            return EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR; // 1 to 1 for first swap => 1e36
        }

        rate_ =
            (poolTotalEstimatedValue  *
                EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) /
            poolSharesToken.totalSupply(); // @audit:  0 * 1e36 / 1e18 = 0
    }
```
And the value for poolTotalEstimatedValue is calculated as follows:
```solidity
//if the poolTotalEstimatedValue is less than 0, we treat it as 0.  
        poolTotalEstimatedValue_ = poolTotalEstimatedValueSigned > int256(0)
            ? uint256(poolTotalEstimatedValueSigned)
            : 0;
```
As it can be seen from above calculation the rate could be 0 and inside `_valueOfUnderlying` function if `rate==0` we return 0.
and finally this return value is set to shareAmount which in this case would be zero.

step to explain POC:
1). User deposit 10 Principal tokens.
2). The `_valueOfUnderlying` get call to calculate the amount of share tokens with the `rate=0`
3). The value return from `_valueOfUnderlying` is 0 and `sharesAmount_=0`.
4). Calls the mint function of `poolSharesToken` to mint `shareAmount` which is 0 in this case.


## Impact
The user will lost Principal token deposited due to 0 share token minted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `minAmountOut` to check for slippage and also add deadline check to prevent  from unforeseen issue. I am not clear but one approach would be to change the rate equation if `poolTotalEstimatedValue` is equal to 0 then return EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR:
```solidity
        if (poolSharesToken.totalSupply() == 0 || poolTotalEstimatedValue ==0) {
            return EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR; // 1 to 1 for first swap => 1e36
        }

```
