# Fee on transfer tokens isn't compatible with LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol

## Summary
From the previous audit, the protocol intended to work with `FEE-ON-TRANSFER: any`, and there was also a valid issues from previous audit regarding fee-on-transfer compliance. There are also comments in `TellerV2.sol` confirming that the protocol interacts with `fee-on-transfer` tokens:
[contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L934](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L934)
```solidity
//used for fee-on-send tokens
uint256 paymentAmountReceived = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
```

## Vulnerability Detail
The `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup` function mints shares with the amount passed as an argument, without checking the actual amount of tokens received.
```solidity
 function addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(
        uint256 _amount,
        address _sharesRecipient
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesAmount_) {
        //transfers the primary principal token from msg.sender into this contract escrow

        principalToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        sharesAmount_ = _valueOfUnderlying(_amount, sharesExchangeRate());

        totalPrincipalTokensCommitted += _amount;
        //principalTokensCommittedByLender[msg.sender] += _amount;

        //mint shares equal to _amount and give them to the shares recipient !!!
        poolSharesToken.mint(_sharesRecipient, sharesAmount_);
    }
```

## Impact
Fee on transfer tokens isn't compatible with `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the amount of tokens that will be received by the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` contract by subtracting `balanceOf` before and after, instead of assuming the amount of tokens that will be received.
