# Protocol fails to work with ERC20s that does NOT revert on failure during transfer.

## Summary

There are ERC20 tokens that does NOT revert on failure during `transfer` of `transferFrom`, but returns a false instead. The protocol fails to work with these kind of tokens, since there are many places that does not check the return value during a transfer. 

## Vulnerability Detail

An example of not revert-on-transfer-failure token is [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code).

The contest README states that any tokens compatible with Uniswap V3 should be supported, which includes ZRX: https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498

> We are allowing any standard token that would be compatible with Uniswap V3 to work with our codebase, just as was the case for the original audit of TellerV2.sol. The tokens are assumed to be able to work with Uniswap V3.

There are in total 7 places that uses `transfer` or `transferFrom` that does not check the return value. All are listed under `Code Snippet` section of this report. Here I will discuss one of the most important ones.

In `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup`, it calls a `transferFrom` to transfer the principal tokens from user to pool, but does not check return value. This means users can pass any amount of `_amount` and doesn't need to own this amount of tokens, and still mint shares. Basically this means users can mint shares for free.

```solidity
    function addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(
        uint256 _amount,
        address _sharesRecipient
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesAmount_) {
        //transfers the primary principal token from msg.sender into this contract escrow
        
>       principalToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        sharesAmount_ = _valueOfUnderlying(_amount, sharesExchangeRate());

        totalPrincipalTokensCommitted += _amount;
        //principalTokensCommittedByLender[msg.sender] += _amount;

        //mint shares equal to _amount and give them to the shares recipient !!!
        poolSharesToken.mint(_sharesRecipient, sharesAmount_);
    }
```

## Impact

Many impacts. One of the most important ones being users can mint `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` pool shares for free.

## Recommendation

Use `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` from `SafeERC20`.
