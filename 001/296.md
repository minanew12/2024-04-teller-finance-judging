# Invalid check in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings()`.

## Summary

Without any other interruption, a malicious user can break the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` by conducting a series of actions: deposit, borrow, liquidate, donation, and withdraw.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's consider the following scenario:
1. Bob deposits 100 wei to an empty `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`.
    - state: Bob's share = 100, totalPrincipalTokensCommitted = 100, totalSupply = 100.
2. Bob borrows 80 wei with no duration.
3. Bob liquidates his loan at the time `_loanDefaultedTimestamp + 86400 + 5000`.
    - state: tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations = -40.
4. Bob donates 60 wei to the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`.
5. Bob withdraws 99 shares.
    - state: totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn = 60, totalSupply = 1.

Finally, the exchange rate will be `(100 - 40 - 60) / 1 = 0`, leading to breaking the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`.

After that, if someone deposits, he will receive no share and Bob can take all of that.
This problem occurs because there is no balance check in withdrawing.
## Impact

Without anyother's interruption, a malicious user can break the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Deposit and withdrawal should be improved as follows.

```diff
    function addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(
        uint256 _amount,
        address _sharesRecipient
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesAmount_) {
        //transfers the primary principal token from msg.sender into this contract escrow
        
        principalToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        sharesAmount_ = _valueOfUnderlying(_amount, sharesExchangeRate());
+       require(sharesAmount > 0); 

        totalPrincipalTokensCommitted += _amount;
        //principalTokensCommittedByLender[msg.sender] += _amount;

        //mint shares equal to _amount and give them to the shares recipient !!!
        poolSharesToken.mint(_sharesRecipient, sharesAmount_);
    }

    function burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings(
        uint256 _amountPoolSharesTokens,
        address _recipient
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        
        poolSharesToken.burn(msg.sender, _amountPoolSharesTokens);

        uint256 principalTokenValueToWithdraw = _valueOfUnderlying(
            _amountPoolSharesTokens,
            sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        );

+       int256 balanceOfPool = int256(totalPrincipalTokensCommitted) - int256(totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn) 
+        + int256(totalInterestCollected)  + int256(tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations) 
+        - int256(totalPrincipalTokensLended) + int256(totalPrincipalTokensRepaid);

+       require(balanceOfPool > 0 && principalTokenValueToWithdraw > 0);
+       require(principalTokenValueToWithdraw <= uint256(balanceOfPool));          

        totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn += principalTokenValueToWithdraw;

        principalToken.transfer(_recipient, principalTokenValueToWithdraw);

        return principalTokenValueToWithdraw;
    }

```
