# Loss From `tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations` Can be Avoided Through Frontrunning

## Summary

LP's for `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` can avoid value loss paid to liquidators by frontrunning a liquidation with a withdrawal.

## Vulnerability Detail

When liquidation occurs, there is a "token difference" given or payed by liquidators. When the liqudiators are paid the token difference, this is a loss to shares owners of `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` via decreasing the value returned by [getPoolTotalEstimatedValue()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L294-L296)

Share owners can avoid this loss by frontrunning the liquidation with `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings()`. This will cause unfair loss for share owners who do not front run as the frontrunner effectiveless avoids all the decrease in exchange rate. The frontrunner can also immediately redeposit after the liquidation tranasction.

## Impact

Share owners can unfairly avoid loss of value due to principal given to liqudiators. Existing share owners consequently suffer a larger proportion of the loss.
