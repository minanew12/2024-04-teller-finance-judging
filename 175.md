# Principal can be added when contract is paused.

## Summary
The protocol has done good job implementing pause/unpause functionality. Functions that are used for depositing/minting should not be interacted with when the contract is paused and functions for withdrawing/burning should allow users to call them at anytime. However one function used for adding principal to commitment group is missing the `whenNotPaused` modifier.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol::addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup` there is no `whenNotPaused` modifier. This modifier is used to stop interactions with the protocol when there is a problem/attack. The current implementation will not stop users from calling this function which may result in losses of principal tokens.

## Impact
Users loosing principal tokens when calling `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup` when contract is paused.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(
        uint256 _amount,
        address _sharesRecipient
    ) external returns (uint256 sharesAmount_) {
        //transfers the primary principal token from msg.sender into this contract escrow
        
        principalToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        sharesAmount_ = _valueOfUnderlying(_amount, sharesExchangeRate());

        totalPrincipalTokensCommitted += _amount;
        //principalTokensCommittedByLender[msg.sender] += _amount;

        //mint shares equal to _amount and give them to the shares recipient !!!
        poolSharesToken.mint(_sharesRecipient, sharesAmount_);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `whenNotPaused` modifier to the function.
