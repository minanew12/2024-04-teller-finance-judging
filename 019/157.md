# User can easily DoS `FlashRolloverLoan_G5` for USDT loans

## Summary
`FlashRolloverLoan_G5` is using Aave flashloan with arbitrary amount, which should be used to repay `TellerV2` loan and then borrow it again. 
The problem is that user can specify the flashLoanAmount (which may be greater than the required for the loan) and that `FlashRolloverLoan_G5` is [approving](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance-NicolaMirchev/blob/b3813d11f7af3f9d19728fbd3532bf8decaad4cd/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/FlashRolloverLoan_G5.sol#L194-L197) `TellerV2` for that same amount, which may not be used. 

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
        uint256 repaymentAmount = _repayLoanFull(
            _rolloverArgs.loanId,
            _flashToken,
            _flashAmount
        );
```
The problem here comes for tokens such as `Tether USD`(USDT), which is one of the most used tokens and his `approve` function looks as follows:
```solidity
    function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {

        // To change the approve amount you first have to reduce the addresses`
        //  allowance to zero by calling `approve(_spender, 0)` if it is not
        //  already 0 to mitigate the race condition described here:
        //  https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729
        require(!((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0)));

        allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    }
```
Function expects `allowance` for `TellerV2` to be reset back to 0, but that never happens and as user can specify `flashloanAmount`, he may provide value, which is with only 1 wei greater than the loan.
This would result in DoS-ing the functionallity to use `FlashRolloverLoan_G5` with USDT and other tokens with the same mechanism, consequent tries to call  `IERC20Upgradeable(_flashToken).approve(
            address(POOL()),
            _flashAmount + _flashFees
        );`  would result in revert
## Impact
DoS for USDT and other tokens with same mechanism

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
After repaying loan, call 
```solidity
IERC20Upgradeable(_flashToken).approve(
            address(POOL()),
            0
        );  would result in revert
