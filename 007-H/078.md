# Burning shares first, then calculating the token to withdraw, results in users receiving more tokens

## Summary

In the function `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings()`, the protocol first burns shares and then calculates `PrincipalTokenValueToWithdraw`. Burning shares reduces the `totalSupply()`, which in turn decreases `sharesExchangeRateInverse`. As a result, users can obtain more principal tokens in the end.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings()`, the protocol first burns shares, then calculates `sharesExchangeRateInverse`, and finally transfers the corresponding amount of principal tokens to the user. 
```solidity
function burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings(
        uint256 _amountPoolSharesTokens,
        address _recipient
    ) external returns (uint256) {
       

        
        poolSharesToken.burn(msg.sender, _amountPoolSharesTokens);

        uint256 principalTokenValueToWithdraw = _valueOfUnderlying(
            _amountPoolSharesTokens,
            sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        );

        totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn += principalTokenValueToWithdraw;

        principalToken.transfer(_recipient, principalTokenValueToWithdraw);

        return principalTokenValueToWithdraw;
    }

```

The formula used to calculate `principalTokenValueToWithdraw` is `principalTokenValueToWithdraw = shares / sharesExchangeRateInverse`.
```solidity
function _valueOfUnderlying(uint256 amount, uint256 rate)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256 value_)
    {
        if (rate == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        value_ = (amount * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) / rate;
    }


```

Let's take a look at the `sharesExchangeRateInverse()` function. In this function, the protocol first calls `sharesExchangeRate()` to calculate the price of shares. 
```solidity
   uint256 principalTokenValueToWithdraw = _valueOfUnderlying(
            _amountPoolSharesTokens,
            sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        );
```

Then, it calculates `sharesExchangeRateInverse` using the formula `sharesExchangeRateInverse = EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR / sharesExchangeRate()`, where EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR is a constant. 
```solidity
    function sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        public
        view
        virtual
        returns (uint256 rate_)
    {
        return
            (EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) /
            sharesExchangeRate();
    }

```

In the `sharesExchangeRate()` function, the rate is calculated as `rate = poolTotalEstimatedValue / totalSupply()`.
```solidity
        rate_ =
            (poolTotalEstimatedValue  *
                EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) /
            poolSharesToken.totalSupply();

```

As seen earlier, the protocol burns shares first, which reduces `totalSupply()`. Consequently, `sharesExchangeRate` increases, while `sharesExchangeRateInverse()` decreases. As a result, `principalTokenValueToWithdraw` increases, allowing the withdrawal of more tokens in the end.

Assuming 
poolTotalValue = 103000*1e18 and totalSupply = 100000*1e18 in the protocol, if a user wants to deposit 10000*1e18, the rate would be calculated as follows: 
rate = poolTotalEstimatedValue*EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR/totalSupply = 103000*1e18*1e36/(100000*1e18) = 1030000000000000000000000000000000000. 
Subsequently, the sharesAmount would be: 
sharesAmount = (amount * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) / rate = 10000*1e18*1e36/1030000000000000000000000000000000000 = 9708737864077669902912

At this point, poolTotalValue would be updated to poolTotalValue =  113000000000000000000000 (103000*1e18 + 10000*1e18), and totalSupply would be updated to totalSupply = 109708737864077669902912 (100000*1e18 + 9708737864077669902912).

Then, if the user calls `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings()` to withdraw, the protocol would first burn shares. After burning shares, totalSupply would be reduced to 100000000000000000000000, rate would be recalculated as 

rate = poolTotalEstimatedValue*EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR/totalSupply = 113000000000000000000000*1e36/100000000000000000000000 = 1130000000000000000000000000000000000, 

sharesExchangeRateInverse would be calculated as 
sharesExchangeRateInverse = EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR*EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR/rate = 1e36*1e36/1130000000000000000000000000000000000 = 884955752212389380530973451327433628 , and principalTokenValueToWithdraw would be calculated as 
principalTokenValueToWithdraw = amount * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR)/sharesExchangeRateInverse =  9708737864077669902912*1e36/884955752212389380530973451327433628 = 10970873786407766990290

Finally, the profit would be profit =  10970873786407766990290 - 100000*1e18 = 970873786407766990290 

Malicious actors can drain funds from the protocol by exploiting the `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup()` and `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings()` functions.
