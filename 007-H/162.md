# `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol::burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings` steal previous depositors funds

## Summary
Users are able to deposit principal token (to be lended) inside `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` smart contract. They receive `PoolSharesTokens` in return, which are initially minted with exchange rate of 1:1 to principal token and when interest is accured in the system, PoolSharesTokens minted per principal token is decreased, so late depositors don't receive old interest rewards.
## Vulnerability Detail
Currently there is a critical problem inside `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings` function, which allows expoiters and even non-malicious users to steal funds from other depositors. Lets take a look at the function and explain why the calucation for principal token is wrong:
```solidity
    function burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings(
        uint256 _amountPoolSharesTokens,
        address _recipient
    ) external returns (uint256) {
       
        
        poolSharesToken.burn(msg.sender, _amountPoolSharesTokens);

        uint256 principalTokenValueToWithdraw = _valueOfUnderlying(
            _amountPoolSharesTokens,
            sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        );

        totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn += principalTokenValueToWithdraw;

        principalToken.transfer(_recipient, principalTokenValueToWithdraw);

        return principalTokenValueToWithdraw;
    }
``` 

We can see that we first burn `poolSharesToken` shares from the user, then we calculate withdraw amount and then we update crucial state varaible `totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn`. Both `totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn` and `poolSharesToken` are used when calculating the exchange rate between `poolSharesToken` and `principalToken` and if we first burn `poolSharesToken`, we inflate the exchange rate, which ends up with greater `principalTokenValueToWithdraw` than it should be.

Lets give a simple example.

- User A deposits 1000e18 WETH and he receives 1000e18 shares. (initial exchange rate is 1:1)
- User B do the same and receive the same amount of shares.

User B calls burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings and this is what is happening
        

We first burn his shares, so poolSharesTokens after this operation is `1000e18`
[sharesExchangeRateInverse](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L277-L286) = EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR ** 2 / sharesExchangeRate (sharesExchangeRate =2000e18 (poolTotalEstimatedValue) * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR / 1000e18 (newTotalSupply) = 2 * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) = 
EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR / 2 = 500000000000000000000000000000000000

1000ะต18 * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR / 500000000000000000000000000000000000 = 2000e18
- The result is that second depositor will withdraw also first depositor funds, because exchangeRate is inflated (it is 2, instead of 1, because of the shares burning before calculation)
- Now if first depositor calls `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings`, rate would be 0, because [getPoolTotalEstimatedValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L265) will calculate allCommited(2000e18) - allWithdrawn (2000e18)
## Impact
Depositors funds being easily stealed

## Recommendation

First calculate shares and then burn:
```diff
    
-   poolSharesToken.burn(msg.sender, _amountPoolSharesTokens);

        uint256 principalTokenValueToWithdraw = _valueOfUnderlying(
            _amountPoolSharesTokens,
            sharesExchangeRateInverse()
        );

+      - poolSharesToken.burn(msg.sender, _amountPoolSharesTokens);
        totalPrincipalTokensWithdrawn += principalTokenValueToWithdraw;

        principalToken.transfer(_recipient, principalTokenValueToWithdraw);

        return principalTokenValueToWithdraw;
```
