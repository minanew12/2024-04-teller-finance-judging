# TellerV2.sol - Liquidators have no incentive to liquidate loans

## Summary
TellerV2.sol - Liquidators have no incentive to liquidate loans.

## Vulnerability Detail
Liquidators work on incentives/rewards so it makes sense for them to liquidate loans, as they have to repay the debt.

There is currently 0 incentive to liquidate a loan, there are no extra rewards/incentives to liquidate a loan, the liquidator has to repay the entire debt + interest and they will only receive the collateral in the `CollateralManager` that was originally locked by the borrower.

```jsx
function _liquidateLoanFull(uint256 _bidId, address _recipient)
        internal
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "liquidateLoan")
    {
        require(isLoanLiquidateable(_bidId), "Loan must be liquidateable.");

        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        // change state here to prevent re-entrancy
        bid.state = BidState.LIQUIDATED;

        (uint256 owedPrincipal, , uint256 interest) = V2Calculations
            .calculateAmountOwed(
                bid,
                block.timestamp,
                _getBidPaymentCycleType(_bidId),
                _getBidPaymentCycleDuration(_bidId)
            );

        //this sets the state to 'repaid'
        _repayLoan(
            _bidId,
            Payment({ principal: owedPrincipal, interest: interest }),
            owedPrincipal + interest,
            false
        );

        /*
         _getCollateralManagerForBid(_bidId).liquidateCollateral(
            _bidId,
            _recipient
        ); 
      */

        collateralManager.liquidateCollateral(_bidId, _recipient);

        address liquidator = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);

        emit LoanLiquidated(_bidId, liquidator);
    }
```


## Impact
Liquidators have no incentives to liquidate loans, thus lenders will be forced to manually close the loan and lose their entire principal.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
One way to give them some incentive is to only make them pay the principal and not pay the interest or add another type of incentive to make them liquidate loans.
