# No deposit limit in `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup` allows lender to get more shares than intended

## Summary

In [LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol), the function used to add principal tokens to the commitment group `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup`, doesn't have a minimum deposit value implemented. This would allow a user to get shares minted with a deposit of 1 wei.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup` is used by lenders to deposit tokens into the contract, which acts as an escrow, in order for them to provide loans without actively tracking them. They deposit an amount of `principalToken` and, in exchange, get `poolSharesToken` minted. However, the first lender can just make a deposit of 1 wei and still get 1 pool share minted, whereas the intended exchange rate is at least 1 Principal Token for 1 poolSharesToken as can be seen in [sharesExchangeRate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L268C51-L268C76). This would allow them to either give out loans and earn interest for "free" or just wait for another user to add principal and burn their share in order to withdraw the shares directly.

## Impact

Loss of funds for the protocol. The first depositor gets to lend out tokens and participate in the `LenderCommitmentGroup` with a share they didn't actually pay for.

## Proof of Concept

The test is modified so that the deposited principal equal to 1 wei, but it's a direct copy of [test_addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/tests/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/SmartCommitments/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart_Test.sol#L142-L164)

```solidity
    function test_addPrincipalToCommitmentGroupModified() public {
        lenderCommitmentGroupSmart.set_mockSharesExchangeRate(1e36);

        initialize_group_contract();

        vm.prank(address(lender));
        principalToken.approve(address(lenderCommitmentGroupSmart), 1);

        vm.prank(address(lender));
        uint256 sharesAmount_ = lenderCommitmentGroupSmart
            .addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup(1, address(borrower));

        uint256 expectedSharesAmount = 1;

        assertEq(
            sharesAmount_,
            expectedSharesAmount,
            "Received an unexpected amount of shares"
        );
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a minimum deposit amount to `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup`, or at least make sure that the first deposit is at least equal to 1 Principal Token.
