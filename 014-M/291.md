# Share Inflation Attack via Internal Accounting

## Summary
- Share Inflation Attack via Internal Accounting
## Vulnerability Detail
- When `poolSharesToken` total supply is zero an attacker goes ahead and executes the following steps :
   -  Deposit a few assets in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol` using  `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup()`
   - Then Attacker creates a Borrow position using SCF contract.
   - Then wait for a block, In 12 seconds when atleast 1 wei of interest has accurred, repay all the borrowed funds and interest.
   - After this they redeem all but 1 wei of shares.
   - This makes it so that the `poolSharesToken` = 1 and `poolTotalEstimatedValue_` >= 2 due to rounding.
   - Now attacker takes advantage of rounding down when depositing to inflate the price of a share.
   -  In a loop attacker does the following till they get their desired price of 1 share
      - deposit 2*(poolTotalEstimatedValue - 1 )assets
        - According to  `(amount * EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) / rate` .  ( rate = poolTotalEstimatedValue  *
                EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) /
            poolSharesToken.totalSupply()`)
        - it mints  shares = (2*poolTotalEstimatedValue - 1 * totalShares) /poolTotalEstimatedValue; of shares.
        - Since the attacker has deposited 2*poolTotalEstimatedValue - 1 assets and totalShares is 1, shares = (2 * 
          (poolTotalEstimatedValue - 1) * 1) / poolTotalEstimatedValue = 1 is minted.
        - This should have been 1.9999... but due to rounding down, the attacker gets minted 1 shares.   
        - This means at this point totalShares = 1+1 = 2 and poolTotalEstimatedValue = poolTotalEstimatedValue + 2* 
          (poolTotalEstimatedValue - 1.
        - After this attacker would burn 1 share using `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings()`.
        - So now totalShares= 1 and poolTotalEstimatedValue = 2*poolTotalEstimatedValue - 1
        - In this loop the supply stays (totalShares) at 1 and poolTotalEstimatedValue increase exponentially.



## Impact
- This attack has two implications: Implicit minimum Amount and funds lost due to rounding errors
 - If an attacker is successful in making 1 share worth z assets and a user tries to mint shares using k*z assets then,
- If k<1, then the user gets zero share and they loose all of their tokens to the attacker
- If k>1, then users still get some shares but they lose (k- floor(k)) * z) of assets which get proportionally divided between existing 
  share holders (including the attacker) due to rounding errors.
- This means that for users to not lose value, they have to make sure that k is an integer.
