# Multiple instances of using IERC20 `transfer` instead of `safeTranfer`

## Summary
Multiple instances of using IERC20 `transfer` instead of `safeTranfer`

## Vulnerability Detail
Throughout multiple instances within the contracts, `transfer` is used instead of `safeTransfer`. This opens up two issues:
1. Contract cannot work with tokens which do not return a `bool` and their `transfer` method.
2. Contract cannot work with tokens which return false instead of reverting on failed transfers.

```solidity
        if (fundsRemaining > 0) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(_flashToken).transfer(
                _rolloverArgs.borrower,
                fundsRemaining
            );
        }
```
Note: as per the ReadMe, project is expected to be able to work with any tokens which are supported by UniV3 
> We are allowing any standard token that would be compatible with Uniswap V3 to work with our codebase, just as was the case for the original audit of TellerV2.sol . The tokens are assumed to be able to work with Uniswap V3 .

## Impact
Protocol cannot work with some tokens
