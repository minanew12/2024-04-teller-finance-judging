# Multiple instances of using `approve` instead of `safeApprove`

## Summary
Multiple instances of using `approve` instead of `safeApprove` 

## Vulnerability Detail
In multiple instances within the contract of the protocol, `approve` is used instead of `safeApprove`. Since the used IERC20 interface expects a returned `bool` value and some tokens do not return such value, the protocol will not be able to operate with such tokens (e.g. `BNB`) 
```solidity
        IERC20Upgradeable(_flashToken).approve(
            address(POOL()),
            _flashAmount + _flashFees
        );
```

Note: as per the ReadMe protocol is expected to work with any token UniV3 works with, hence it is expected to work with tokens which do not return `bool` on their `approve` method.
> We are allowing any standard token that would be compatible with Uniswap V3 to work with our codebase, just as was the case for the original audit of TellerV2.sol . The tokens are assumed to be able to work with Uniswap V3 .

## Impact
Contract cannot work with tokens which do not return `bool` on their `approve` method.
