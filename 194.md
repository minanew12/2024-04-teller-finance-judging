# Return values of transfers/approvals are not checked `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol`


## Summary

In various functions such as `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings`, `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup`, and `liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive`, silent transfer failures may occur, resulting in different scenarios: potential loss of user funds, loss of protocol funds, and flawed variable values, ultimately affecting collateral distribution.

> A silent failure could also occur in `acceptFundsForAcceptBid()` for the approval

## Vulnerability Detail

First note that this has been stated in the readme: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/README.md#L12-L16

### Q: If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of <a href="https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weird tokens</a> you want to integrate?

We are allowing any standard token that would be compatible with Uniswap V3 to work with our codebase, just as was the case for the original audit of TellerV2.sol . The tokens are assumed to be able to work with Uniswap V3 .
---
```

Now in multiple instance in scope, the integrated ERC20 token is attempted to be approved/transferred/transferFrommed, however all instances of this in the [LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol) contract calls the un-safe `approve/transfer/transferFrom()` defined in openzeppelin's `ERC20` and the does not check the bool.

Now going to openzeppelin's ERC20's `approvetransfer/transferFrom()` implementation we can see them specified like this https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol#L41-L78 with the bool value to be returned.

```solidity
    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
    (...snip)
    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
    (...snip)
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
```

This is done cause most standard ERC20 tokens do not revert on failures but rather return a bool.

Now in the current scope in the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol` these unsafe methods of transfers are used in `liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive`, `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings` & `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup`.

Since these attempts to transfer could silently fail, this then leads to multiple scenarios like:

- For `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings`, this could lead to user's loss of funds as the attempt to transfer would silently fail, but the user's shares are already burnt and effectively meaning that they receive `0` principal token for any `_amountPoolSharesTokens` they burn.
- For `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup` , this means loss of protocol funds as the attempt at transferring could fail but users still get minted the shares with the assumption that the transfer didn't fail and they can later on withdraw the shares via `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings` as earnings.
- Finally, for `liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive` , here it's being used in two instances, both depending on whether the `_tokenAmountDifference` is -ve or +ve, but all in all this still ends up with the liquidator having to send these tokens to cover the liquidation attempt, which could in this case silently fail, and then the variables `tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations` & `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` would both be flawed, exarcebatingly this then sends the collateral to the user via `  ITellerV2(TELLER_V2).lenderCloseLoanWithRecipient(_bidId, msg.sender);` where as they didn'd successfulyy provide the assets for this liquidation.

## Impact

As stated under _## Vulnerability Detail_, current implementations in `burnSharesToWithdrawEarnings`, `addPrincipalToCommitmentGroup`, & `liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive` are flawed, since silent transfer failures may occur, resulting in different scenarios: potential loss of user funds, loss of protocol funds, and flawed variable values, ultimately affecting collateral distribution.

As for the case of the approval's return value not being checked in `acceptFundsForAcceptBid`, this might break the implementation of[ the call to `TellerV2.sol` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L380-L390) as they include some transfer logics that would need the approvals to succeed

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider checking the return values and ensuring that these transfers/approvals were successful and revert when they are not successful.

Alternatively, just use openzeppelin's `SafeERC20` instead just as is done in TellerV2.sol https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/defe55469a2576735af67483acf31d623e13592d/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L58

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";
//(...snip)
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;
```
