# Potential Risk in Collateral Withdrawal During Loan Repayment

## Summary

However, there is no explicit verification or assurance provided regarding the safety of collateral withdrawal. If there are circumstances under which collateral withdrawal could result in some collateral becoming stuck, it poses a risk to the lending platform.
