# Liquidator Can Be Sandwiched or Self Sandwich To Capture `tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations`

## Summary

Liquidators can be sandwiched or self-sandwiched to capture the tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations

## Vulnerability Detail

When liquidation occurs, there is a "token difference" given or payed by liquidators. When paying a token difference, this is distributed to shares owners of `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` by increasing the value returned by [`getPoolTotalEstimatedValue()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L294-L296)

The problem is that the either a random user or even the liquidator themselves can sandwich the liquidation with a flash deposit+withdrawal to capture the `tokenDifference` which was supposed to be given to stakers.

This only negatively impacts share owners, while going profit to the sandwicher but does not the harm the liquidator themselves. Therefore the liquidator can **sandwich themselves**. Since they can execute the transaction in 1 block, they can flashloan tokens, thus increasing the effectiveness of the attack.

## Impact

LP's in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` do not get their fair share of the liquidation bonus as their rewards are diluted by frontrunning.

## Recommendation

There can be a "delay time" (such as a 24 hour delay) between when principal is added before it converts to shares which get allocated gains/losses from liquidation.
