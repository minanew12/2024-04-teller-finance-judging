# The interest rate model should be improved in the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`.

## Summary

The interest rate is fixed when the loan is made.

## Vulnerability Detail

The interest rate is determined based on the `PoolUtilizationRatio` when the loan is made.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L757-L771

```solidity

    function getPoolUtilizationRatio() public view returns (uint16) {
        [...]
        return uint16(  Math.min(   
           getTotalPrincipalTokensOutstandingInActiveLoans()  * 10000  / 
@>         getPoolTotalEstimatedValue() , 10000  ));
    }   
 
    function getMinInterestRate() public view returns (uint16) {
@>      return interestRateLowerBound + uint16( uint256(interestRateUpperBound-interestRateLowerBound).percent(getPoolUtilizationRatio()) );
    }
```
 However, the `PoolUtilizationRatio` is determined before incrementing `totalPrincipalTokensLended`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder/extensions/LenderCommitmentGroup/LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#L336-L382

```solidity
    function acceptFundsForAcceptBid(
        [...]
@>      require(_interestRate >= getMinInterestRate(), "Invalid interest rate");
        [...]
@>      totalPrincipalTokensLended += _principalAmount;
        [...]
    }
```

So, a user can borrow total amount of liquidity available in the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` with the current interest rate which can be very low. Then `PoolUtilizationRatio` will become very high, but the liquidity providers will recieve interest based on the low interest rate fixed when the loan is made. 

## Impact

The liquidity providers would receive less interset than expected.
