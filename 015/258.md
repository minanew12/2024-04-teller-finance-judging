# Failure to Reset Allowance to Zero Before Changing it

## Summary
The allowance was not reset to zero before modifying it, which could lead to issues with certain ERC20 tokens like USDT.
## Vulnerability Detail
Certain ERC20 tokens, such as USDT, do not allow changing the allowance from a non-zero value without first setting it to zero. For instance, Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero to prevent front-running changes in approvals.
## Impact
Several functionalities within the vaults may not work as expected if the approve function reverts.

## Recommendation
It is advised to always reset the allowance to zero before modifying it and consider using `safeApprove` or `safeIncreaseAllowance` to handle allowance changes safely.
