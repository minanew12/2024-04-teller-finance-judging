# Did not approve to zero first.

## Summary
Allowance was not set to zero first before changing the allowance.
## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value.
## Impact
 For example Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.
However, if the token involved is an ERC20 token that does not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value, it will break a number of key functions or features of the protocol as the `approve` function is used inside key functions, such as `FlashRolloverLoan_G5::_repayLoanFull` for example:
```solidity
function _repayLoanFull(
        uint256 _bidId,
        address _principalToken,
        uint256 _repayAmount
    ) internal returns (uint256 repayAmount_) {
        uint256 fundsBeforeRepayment = IERC20Upgradeable(_principalToken)
            .balanceOf(address(this));

        IERC20Upgradeable(_principalToken).approve(
            address(TELLER_V2),
            _repayAmount
        );
        TELLER_V2.repayLoanFull(_bidId);

        uint256 fundsAfterRepayment = IERC20Upgradeable(_principalToken)
            .balanceOf(address(this));
        repayAmount_ = fundsBeforeRepayment - fundsAfterRepayment;
    }
```

## Code Snippet
The following attempt to call the approve() function without setting the allowance to zero first:

```solidity
IERC20Upgradeable(_flashToken).approve(
            address(POOL()),
            _flashAmount + _flashFees
        );
```

```solidity
IERC20Upgradeable(_principalToken).approve(
            address(TELLER_V2),
            _repayAmount
        );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to set the allowance to zero before increasing the allowance.
