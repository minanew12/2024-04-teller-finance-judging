# Using transferFrom insted safeTransferFrom can lead to incorrect logic with non revert on failure

## Summary
Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead return false (e.g. [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code), [EURS](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdb25f211ab05b1c97d595516f45794528a807ad8#code)).  Because of [this call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2-audit-2024/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L911) doesnt use safeTransferFrom and doesnt check return value. This may cause a failed transaction to be detected by the system as a completed transaction and disrupt the loan disbursement logic
## Vulnerability Detail
The `TellerV2::__sendOrEscrowFunds` function is called on any loan repayment.  Dangerous call transfers funds from the borrower to the lender.  Since none of the functions that occur in the call tree when __sendOrEscrowFunds is called have validation that the user actually owns the amount he wants to repay, the loan can be repaid even with a 0 balance.
## Impact
The attack, although unlikely due to the very narrow range of dangerous tokens, carries a large financial loss.
