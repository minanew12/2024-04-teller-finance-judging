# Locking Collateral in the Contract

## Summary
Tokens will be permanently locked in the LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart contract if used as a principal token.
## Vulnerability Detail
Certain ERC20 tokens, like BNB, return a bool value instead of reverting when transfer() and transferFrom() function calls fail. This can lead to transaction failures not being reverted, potentially resulting in loss of funds.
## Impact
Failure of token transfers can lead to significant issues. For instance, using a token like BNB as the principal token may cause users to lose their poolShareToken.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using OpenZeppelin's `safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom()` function, which can handle cases where the return value is missing.
