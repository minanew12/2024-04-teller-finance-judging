# Unchecked `transferFrom` value may lead to borrower falsy repaying loan

## Summary
There are multiple places, where return value from erc20.transfer/transferFrom is not checked, which may be problem, because protocol is expected to be working with different ERC20 tokens and by standard `transfer/transferFrom` should return `true` if transffer was succefull and `false` otherwise.
So major problems may arrise, such as user burning `poolSharesTokens`  without receiving `principalToken` in return, if this is not handled.
