# Borrower can keep loan.

## Summary
When a borrower repays for his loan, the payment is either send to the lender or to the escrow. The protocol has added `try/catch` block to be sure that if payment can not be send to the lender directly, it will be send to the escrow. However if tokens that return boolean on transfer is used, no one will receive payment and loan will be marked as paid.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is that inside the `try` transferFrom is used instead of safeTransferFrom. Consider the following scenario:

1. Malicious borrower wants a loan for a token that returns boolean on transfer.
2. Lender accepts the bid and lends the borrower tokens.
3. Borrower transfers all tokens to another account and calls `repayLoanFull`.
4. The transferFrom returns false instead of reverting and payment is not send to escrow.

## Impact
Malicious borrower can get tokens for free.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        try 

            bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.transferFrom{ gas: 100000 }(
                _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
                lender,
                _paymentAmount
            )
        {} catch {
            address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);

            uint256 balanceBefore = bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.balanceOf(
                address(this)
            ); 

            //if unable, pay to escrow
            bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
                sender,
                address(this),
                _paymentAmount
            );

            uint256 balanceAfter = bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.balanceOf(
                address(this)
            );

            //used for fee-on-send tokens
            uint256 paymentAmountReceived = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;

            bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.approve(
                address(escrowVault),
                paymentAmountReceived
            );

            IEscrowVault(escrowVault).deposit(
                lender,
                address(bid.loanDetails.lendingToken),
                paymentAmountReceived
            );
        }

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `safeTransferFrom` so it will always revert.
