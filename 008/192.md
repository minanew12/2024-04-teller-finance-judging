# If repayment fails, the lender may lose funds

## Summary
The `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` contract, acting as a lender, provides funds to borrowers. 
When repayment fails, the protocol retries the transfer and deposits the funds into the `EscrowVault` for the lender to withdraw. However, there is no method implemented in the lender contract to withdraw funds from the `EscrowVault`, resulting in the inability to retrieve funds deposited into the `EscrowVault`.


## Vulnerability Detail
The `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` contract, acting as a lender, provides funds to borrowers. When a borrower's loan is repaid, the protocol calls `_sendOrEscrowFunds()` to attempt transferring lending tokens from `_msgSenderForMarket()` to the lender. 
```solidity
   try 

            bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.transferFrom{ gas: 100000 }(
                _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
                lender,
                _paymentAmount
            )

```
If the transfer fails, the protocol deposits the funds into the `escrowVault`. 
```solidity
 bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.approve(
                address(escrowVault),
                paymentAmountReceived
            );

            IEscrowVault(escrowVault).deposit(
                lender,
                address(bid.loanDetails.lendingToken),
                paymentAmountReceived
            );

```

In this case, to withdraw the funds, one can only call `EscrowVault.withdraw()`. 
```solidity
   function withdraw(address token, uint256 amount) external {
        address account = _msgSender();

        balances[account][token] -= amount;
        ERC20(token).safeTransfer(account, amount);
    }

```

As mentioned earlier, while the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` contract serves as a lender providing funds to borrowers, it does not provide a mechanism to withdraw funds from `EscrowVault`, if a repayment fails and the funds are deposited into the escrowVault.

## Impact
The lender will lose the funds.
