# The LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart smart contract may lose principal tokens in EscrowVault.sol

## Summary
There is a scenario in which repaying a loan results in principal tokens being sent to `EscrowVault` , and the lender can withdraw them. However, `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` does not account for this case.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the borrower transfers principal tokens to the lender (`_sendOrEscrowFunds`), but for some reason (such as `transferFrom` consuming more than 100,000 gas, the lender being blacklisted, etc.), the transaction does not revert but instead falls into a catch block where the principal tokens are transferred to `EscrowVault.sol`.
```solidity
try
     bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.transferFrom{ gas: 100000 }(
          _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
           lender,
          _paymentAmount
       )
{} catch {
            //code

            IEscrowVault(escrowVault).deposit(
                lender,
                address(bid.loanDetails.lendingToken),
                paymentAmountReceived
            );
        }
```

Additionally, the `repayLoanCallback` function is called in the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` smart contract, which increases `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` and `totalInterestCollected`. This is incorrect because the principal tokens (`_payment.principal + _payment.interest`) are in `EscrowVault.sol`:
```solidity
 if (loanRepaymentListener != address(0)) {
            try
                ILoanRepaymentListener(loanRepaymentListener).repayLoanCallback{
                    gas: 80000
                }( //limit gas costs to prevent lender griefing repayments
                    _bidId,
                    _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
                    _payment.principal,
                    _payment.interest
                )
            {} catch {}
        }
```


## Impact
This will result in the principal tokens being locked in `EscrowVault` forever because `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` didn't implement the `withdraw` function. The price of shares will increase because the `totalInterestCollected` variable will grow, but the amount of principal tokens will remain the same.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider changing the logic of the _sendOrEscrowFunds internal function in TellerV2.sol:
```diff
try
            bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.transferFrom{ gas: 100000 }(
                _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
                lender,
                _paymentAmount
            )
        {
+            if (loanRepaymentListener != address(0)) {
+               try
+                    ILoanRepaymentListener(loanRepaymentListener)
+                        .repayLoanCallback{ gas: 80000 }( //limit gas costs to prevent lender griefing repayments
+                        _bidId,
+                        _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
+                       _payment.principal,
+                        _payment.interest
+                    )
+                {} catch {}
            }
        } catch {
```

When principal tokens end up in `EscrowVault.sol`, a complex solution is required to address this issue. `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` smart contract need to implement a function that records `pending totalPrincipalTokensRepaid and totalInterestCollected` for the `bidId`. Additionally, a function must be implemented in `EscrowVault.sol` to withdraw principal tokens from `EscrowVault.sol ` and increase `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid and totalInterestCollected` by the pending values.

There may be an easier solution to this issue, but for now, this is the only one I have devised.
