# FlashRolloverLoan is unusable as `SmartCommitmentForwarder` does not inherit `ERC2711ContextUpgradeable`

## Summary
`SmartCommitmentForwarder` does not inherit the needed `ERC2711ContextUpgradeable`.

## Vulnerability Detail
When attempting to rollover a loan within `FlashRolloverLoan_G5.sol`, the contract is treated as a trusted forwarder - it calls `SmartCommitmentForwarder` by appending the `borrower` to the last 20 bytes of the function call 

```solidity
             bytes memory responseData = address(lenderCommitmentForwarder)
                    .functionCall(
                        abi.encodePacked(
                            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                                ISmartCommitmentForwarder
                                    .acceptSmartCommitmentWithRecipient
                                    .selector,
                                _commitmentArgs.smartCommitmentAddress,
                                _commitmentArgs.principalAmount,
                                _commitmentArgs.collateralAmount,
                                _commitmentArgs.collateralTokenId,
                                _commitmentArgs.collateralTokenAddress,
                                address(this),
                                _commitmentArgs.interestRate,
                                _commitmentArgs.loanDuration
                            ),
                            borrower //cant be msg.sender because of the flash flow
                        )
                    );
```

The problem is that within `SmartCommitmentForwarder`, `ERC2711ContextUpgradeable` is not actually inherited, hence even when called by `FlashRolloverLoan`, `_msgSender()` will always return the `msg.sender` (`FlashRolloverLoan`) and not the actual `borrower`. 

```solidity
        bidId = _submitBidWithCollateral(createLoanArgs, _msgSender());  // @audit - this will return the msg.sender

        _commitment.acceptFundsForAcceptBid(
            _msgSender(), //borrower // @audit - this will return the msg.sender
            bidId,
            _principalAmount,
            _collateralAmount,
            _collateralTokenAddress,
            _collateralTokenId,
            _loanDuration,
            _interestRate
        );
```
Since the `FlashRolloverLoan_G5` will not have any collateral funds, nor will have set an approval to the TellerV2 contract, all attempts to flash rollover a loan will fail. 


## Impact
`FlashRolloverLoan_G5` is unusable
