# The FlashRolloverLoan_G5 smart contract invokes a function that has not been implemented

## Summary
The `FlashRolloverLoan_G5` smart contract invokes a function that has not been implemented.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a borrower executes the `rolloverLoanWithFlash` function in the `FlashRolloverLoan_G5` smart contract, they pass the `_acceptCommitmentArgs` argument, which is then used to determine how the borrower wants to accept a loan commitment (either through a Smart Forwarder, a Merkle proof, or a standard method).


If `_commitmentArgs.smartCommitmentAddress is not equal to address(0)`, then the borrower wants to accept the commitment through `acceptSmartCommitmentWithRecipient` function, which is must implemented in `LenderCommitmentForwarder`. However, there is no function implemented in this smart contract:

```solidity
if (_commitmentArgs.smartCommitmentAddress != address(0)) {
            bytes memory responseData = address(lenderCommitmentForwarder)
                .functionCall(
                    abi.encodePacked(
                        abi.encodeWithSelector(
                            ISmartCommitmentForwarder
-->                             .acceptSmartCommitmentWithRecipient
                                .selector,
                            _commitmentArgs.smartCommitmentAddress,
                            _commitmentArgs.principalAmount,
                            _commitmentArgs.collateralAmount,
                            _commitmentArgs.collateralTokenId,
                            _commitmentArgs.collateralTokenAddress,
                            address(this),
                            _commitmentArgs.interestRate,
                            _commitmentArgs.loanDuration
                        ),
                        borrower //cant be msg.sender because of the flash flow
                    )
                );

            (bidId_) = abi.decode(responseData, (uint256));
        }
```

## Impact
The user cannot accept the commitment when `smartCommitmentAddress != address(0)`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As I understand it, when `_commitmentArgs.smartCommitmentAddress != address(0)`, the `acceptCommitmentWithRecipient` function in the `SmartCommitmentForwarder` smart contract should be called:
```diff
if (_commitmentArgs.smartCommitmentAddress != address(0)) {
-            bytes memory responseData = address(lenderCommitmentForwarder)
+            bytes memory responseData = address(smartCommitmentForwarder)
                .functionCall(
                    abi.encodePacked(
                        abi.encodeWithSelector(
                            ISmartCommitmentForwarder // add `acceptCommitmentWithRecipient` to the interface
-                             .acceptSmartCommitmentWithRecipient
+                             .acceptCommitmentWithRecipient
                                .selector,
                            _commitmentArgs.smartCommitmentAddress,
                            _commitmentArgs.principalAmount,
                            _commitmentArgs.collateralAmount,
                            _commitmentArgs.collateralTokenId,
                            _commitmentArgs.collateralTokenAddress,
                            address(this),
                            _commitmentArgs.interestRate,
                            _commitmentArgs.loanDuration
                        ),
                        borrower //cant be msg.sender because of the flash flow
                    )
                );

            (bidId_) = abi.decode(responseData, (uint256));
        }
```
