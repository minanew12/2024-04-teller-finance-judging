# `_collateralAmount` is multiplied by `STANDARD_EXPANSION_FACTOR` unreasonably in the collateral check of the `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.acceptFundsForAcceptBid()` function.

## Summary

In collateral checking of `acceptFundsForAcceptBid()`, `_collateralAmount` is multiplied by STANDARD_EXPANSION_FACTOR unreasonably. So, a user can a large amount of liquidity, even though he has no enough collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

In collateral checking of `acceptFundsForAcceptBid()`, `_collateralAmount` is multiplied by STANDARD_EXPANSION_FACTOR. The comment said that it is expanded by 10**18. However, it is not expanded by 10**18 anywhere.

```solidity

    function acceptFundsForAcceptBid(
        [...]
@>      //this is expanded by 10**18
        uint256 requiredCollateral = getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount(
            _principalAmount
        );

        require(
@>          (_collateralAmount * STANDARD_EXPANSION_FACTOR) >=
                requiredCollateral,
            "Insufficient Borrower Collateral"
        );
        [...]
    }

```

As a result, a user can a large amount of liquidity, even though he has no enough collateral.

## Impact

A user with very loss collateral can borrow a large amount of liquidity. This may lead to a critical loss of fund.
