# LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount() - Doesn't scale by 1e18

## Summary
LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol#getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount() - Doesn't scale by 1e18

## Vulnerability Detail
When `acceptFundsForAcceptBid` we use `getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount` to calculate how much collateral is needed for the bid.

```solidity
function acceptFundsForAcceptBid(
        address _borrower,
        uint256 _bidId,
        uint256 _principalAmount,
        uint256 _collateralAmount,
        address _collateralTokenAddress,
        uint256 _collateralTokenId,
        uint32 _loanDuration,
        uint16 _interestRate
    ) external onlySmartCommitmentForwarder whenNotPaused {
        require(
            _collateralTokenAddress == address(collateralToken),
            "Mismatching collateral token"
        );
        //the interest rate must be at least as high has the commitment demands. The borrower can use a higher interest rate although that would not be beneficial to the borrower.
        require(_interestRate >= getMinInterestRate(), "Invalid interest rate");
        //the loan duration must be less than the commitment max loan duration. The lender who made the commitment expects the money to be returned before this window.
        require(_loanDuration <= maxLoanDuration, "Invalid loan max duration");

        require(
            getPrincipalAmountAvailableToBorrow() >= _principalAmount,
            "Invalid loan max principal"
        );

        //this is expanded by 10**18
        uint256 requiredCollateral = getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount(
            _principalAmount
        );

        require(
            (_collateralAmount * STANDARD_EXPANSION_FACTOR) >=
                requiredCollateral,
            "Insufficient Borrower Collateral"
        );
```

Notice that the function specifically states that the amount is expanded by 1e18.

This is incorrect, the value is never expanded by 1e18, to demonstrate I'll show what the function returns if `principalToken` is WETH and collateral token is USDC.

[This is the USDC/WETH pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x88e6a0c2ddd26feeb64f039a2c41296fcb3f5640#readContract).

To simplify I'll skip the `worstCasePairPrice` variable and the `collateralRatio`, as it they have no effect on the calculation.

```solidity
// We want to know how much USDC we will need for 1e18 WETH
sqrtPriceX96 = 1374686770030943534375716675833953

_getPriceFromSqrtX96 = (1374686770030943534375716675833953 * 1374686770030943534375716675833953) / 2^96

// Since WETH is token1 in the pool, we use token0ToToken1

USDC Amount = (1e18 * 2^96) / 23852171446710919350081597432384739490 = 3321633113
```

As you can see the value comes out in USDC (6 decimals)

This value that `getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount` will return is `3321633113` and is then used the following require statement.

```solidity
require(
            (_collateralAmount * STANDARD_EXPANSION_FACTOR) >=
                requiredCollateral,
            "Insufficient Borrower Collateral"
        );
```

## Impact
Since `STANDARD_EXPANSION_FACTOR = 1e18` even if `_collateralAmount = 1` the check will pass, in effect a user can get 1e18 WETH for 1 wei of USDC, making it basically free.

Anyone can easily exploit the contract this way and completely drain it.

Note that this affect every pool, the demonstration is with the USDC/WETH pool as it's easy to demonstrate the issue.

## Recommendation
Scale the value returned from `getCollateralRequiredForPrincipalAmount` by 1e18.
