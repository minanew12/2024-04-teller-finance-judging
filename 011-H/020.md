# No way for `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` to claim funds deposited into an `EscrowVault`

## Summary
No way for `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` to claim funds deposited into an `EscrowVault`

## Vulnerability Detail
When repaying a loan within `TellerV2`, if the repayment transfer fails, the funds are deposited into an `escrowVault` from which lender has to later claim them. 

```solidity
            bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.approve(
                address(escrowVault),
                paymentAmountReceived
            );

            IEscrowVault(escrowVault).deposit(
                lender,
                address(bid.loanDetails.lendingToken),
                paymentAmountReceived
            );
```

The problem is that `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` has no way to claim these funds, meaning that they'll be forever stuck.

An example scenario for when the vault will be used is if the principal token is USDT - since the transfer to the lender uses `transferFrom` (rather than `safeTransferFrom`), USDT repayments will always enter the `catch` statement and be deposited in the EscrowVault, where they'll be permanently stuck.
