# LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol - If a loan gets escrowed, the contract can't get the funds out

## Summary
LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart.sol - If a loan gets escrowed, the contract can't get the funds out

## Vulnerability Detail
When a loan gets repaid/liquidated, `_repayLoan` which will then always call `_sendOrEscrowFunds`.

The function first attempts to try to transfer the lending tokens to the lender, if that fails it sends the tokens to the `EscrowVaul`.
```solidity
 function _sendOrEscrowFunds(uint256 _bidId, Payment memory _payment)
        internal
    {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];
        address lender = getLoanLender(_bidId);

        uint256 _paymentAmount = _payment.principal + _payment.interest;

        try 

            bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.transferFrom{ gas: 100000 }(
                _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
                lender,
                _paymentAmount
            )
        {} catch {
            address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);

            uint256 balanceBefore = bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.balanceOf(
                address(this)
            ); 

            //if unable, pay to escrow
            bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
                sender,
                address(this),
                _paymentAmount
            );

            uint256 balanceAfter = bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.balanceOf(
                address(this)
            );

            //used for fee-on-send tokens
            uint256 paymentAmountReceived = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;

            bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.approve(
                address(escrowVault),
                paymentAmountReceived
            );

            IEscrowVault(escrowVault).deposit(
                lender,
                address(bid.loanDetails.lendingToken),
                paymentAmountReceived
            );
        }

        address loanRepaymentListener = repaymentListenerForBid[_bidId];

        if (loanRepaymentListener != address(0)) {
            try
                ILoanRepaymentListener(loanRepaymentListener).repayLoanCallback{
                    gas: 80000
                }( //limit gas costs to prevent lender griefing repayments
                    _bidId,
                    _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
                    _payment.principal,
                    _payment.interest
                )
            {} catch {}
        }
    }
```
If the tokens get sent to the `EscrowVault` the lender must call `withdraw` to retrieve the tokens.

The issue occurs if the lender is `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`, as the contract is built around the idea that users pool their tokens together and allow other users to submit and accept bids through the contract, thus when a bid is accepted through the contract, the lender is the contract itself.

The problem is that `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` doesn't call the `EscrowVault.withdraw` anywhere, it doesn't even have a state variable dedicated to the escrow vault.

Because of this if tokens are ever sent to the escrow vault, the contract can never retrieve them and they are stuck forever. 
```solidity
function withdraw(address token, uint256 amount) external {
        address account = _msgSender();

        balances[account][token] -= amount;
        ERC20(token).safeTransfer(account, amount);
    }
```

On top of this `repayLoanCallback` will always be called when `_sendOrEscrowFunds` is called, so `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` will always assume it has received the tokens, by incrementing `totalPrincipalTokensRepaid` and `totalInterestCollected`, which affect:

* `getPoolTotalEstimatedValue`
* `getTotalPrincipalTokensOutstandingInActiveLoans` 

Which in turn will affect the pool utilization ratio and the principal amount available to borrow.

## Impact
Loss of funds for the contract and it's users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Inside `repayLoanCallback` check if any funds were escrowed and if they are, call `EscrowVault.withdraw`
