# Stuck tokens in `TellerV2` if `bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.transferFrom()` fails as `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` can not withdraw from `EscrowVault`

## Summary

`TellerV2::_sendOrEscrowFunds()` deposits the lenders' funds into a `EscrowVault` if `bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.transferFrom` fails, but `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` has no way to get the funds back from the `EscrowVault`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`TellerV2::_sendOrEscrowFunds()` is called on `TellerV2::_repayLoan()` and is meant to send principal back to the lender (`payment`). It first tries to send the funds by calling `bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.transferFrom{ gas: 100000 }()`, but if the call fails (due to a variety of reasons, for example, a token not returning a `bool` on `transferFrom()`, an `ERC777` token that is triggering some sort of callback, and so on), it goes to the `catch` section and pushes the funds to an `EscrowVault`, which can then later be withdrawn by the lender.

The problem is that the lender might be `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`, which has no way to withdraw funds from the `EscrowVault` and would lead to stuck tokens.

## Impact

Stuck tokens due to the inability of `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart` to withdraw funds from the `EscrowVault`.

            address(this)
        );

        //used for fee-on-send tokens
        uint256 paymentAmountReceived = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;

        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.approve(
            address(escrowVault),
            paymentAmountReceived
        );

        IEscrowVault(escrowVault).deposit(
            lender,
            address(bid.loanDetails.lendingToken),

        );
    }

## Recommendation

The catch section is not really required, just use `safeTransferFrom()`. If the call reverts due to any reason, some other address may be used to repay the loan.
