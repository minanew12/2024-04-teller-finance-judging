# Missing valid address check for "_collateralTokenAddress" parameter leading to funds loss for lender

## Summary
Missing valid address check for "_collateralTokenAddress" parameter leading to funds loss vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside "acceptCommitmentWithRecipient" function there is a parameter "_collateralTokenAddress" which has to be checked if it is valid address, starting with 0 address check, cause this will lead to lost/burned funds of lender otherwise. Also the way that the code is written the "msg.sender" can provide some other (3d party) address for collateral, would suggest instead of accepting this parameter "_collateralTokenAddress" instead directly use "msg.sender" and hold the end user caller responsible for its own loans.

## Impact
High since might result in funds loss for the contract that loans funds. Likelihood is high as well since, anyway can call this function and provide any ones "_collateralTokenAddress".

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. 0 address check should be made such as:
 
```solidity
   require(address(_collateralTokenAddress) != address(0), "_collateralTokenAddress cannot be 0x0!");
```
2. Instead of accepting "_collateralTokenAddress" as method parameter use "msg.sender"
