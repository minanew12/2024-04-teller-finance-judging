# If a bid's state gets updated while `_repayLoan` is getting executed, user funds will get frozen

## Summary

Once a user has decided to pay off their loan, if the loan defaults, the `bid.state` will get updated to `LIQUIDATED`, which won't allow the user to withdraw their collateral, as the bid's state has to be `PAID`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function the borrower ideally uses to repay their loan is: `repayLoan`, which only takes the parameters `_bidId` and `_amount`. Once it gets called, a call to `_repayLoanAtleastMinimum` is made, where an additional parameter is added `withdrawCollateral` - if set to true (which it is hardcoded to), the user's remaining collateral in the loan would be withdrawn. An issue arises if the loan defaults, which in turn would set the bid's state to `LIQUIDATED` when a liquidator liquidates it. This would make the check from below not update the `bid.state` (the state was `ACCEPTED` once `repayLoan` was called).

```solidity
if (bid.state != BidState.LIQUIDATED) {
 bid.state = BidState.PAID;
}
```
After that, `_shouldWithdrawCollateral` comes into play: 
```solidity
// If loan is is being liquidated and backed by collateral, withdraw and send to borrower
if (_shouldWithdrawCollateral) {
 //   _getCollateralManagerForBid(_bidId).withdraw(_bidId);
  collateralManager.withdraw(_bidId);
}
```
However, the function will simply revert, as the function requires the bidState to be `PAID`.

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _bidId) external {
 BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);

 require(bidState == BidState.PAID, "collateral cannot be withdrawn");

 _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId));

 emit CollateralClaimed(_bidId);
}
```

## Impact

Loss of funds. The user repays their loan but won't get their collateral back. In addition to that, one of the flows of `repayLoan` is completely broken.

## Proof of Concept

A test is already written in `tests/TellerV2/TellerV2_bids.sol`, the only update that has to be done is - `tellerV2._repayLoanSuper(bidId, payment, 100, true);`

    function test_repay_loan_internal_leave_state_as_liquidated() public {
        uint256 bidId = 1;
        setMockBid(bidId);

        //set address(this) as the account that will be paying off the loan
        tellerV2.setMockMsgSenderForMarket(address(this));

        tellerV2.setReputationManagerSuper(address(reputationManagerMock));

        tellerV2.mock_setBidState(bidId, BidState.LIQUIDATED);
        vm.warp(2000);

        Payment memory payment = Payment({ principal: 90, interest: 10 });

        lendingToken.approve(address(tellerV2), 1e20);

        tellerV2._repayLoanSuper(bidId, payment, 100, true);

        BidState bidStateAfter = tellerV2.getBidState(bidId);

        require(
            bidStateAfter == BidState.LIQUIDATED,
            "Should retain state as LIQUIDATED"
        );
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It would be fair for the bid's state to get updated to `PAID` if the borrower has provided paymentAmount >= _owedAmount.
