# Marketplace Fee for loan can be updated any time after bid until lender accepts

## Summary
A user creates a bid for a loan using `submitBid()`. Upon submitting the bid, the marketplace fee is not stored. Instead, when the lender accepts the bid using `lenderAccetBid()`, the marketplace fee is queried from the `MarketplaceRegistry` contract and used to calculate the amount of principal owed to the borrower. This fee can be updated up to 100% by the marketplace owner at any time between the bid submission to loan acceptance.

## Vulnerability Detail
The marketplace fee should be written to the loan's storage to ensure that the updates to the fee cannot affect a bid retroactively. The marketplace owner can update the fee so large that the borrower receives 0 principal.

```solidity
        amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
            marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
        );
        amountToBorrower =
            bid.loanDetails.principal -
            amountToProtocol -
            amountToMarketplace;
```

## Impact
- Borrowers can receive 0-value loans due to updates to the marketplace fee percent, even after their bid has been submitted.
