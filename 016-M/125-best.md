# Issue #497 'Add parameter to lender accept bid for MaxMarketFee' from previous audit is still present

## Summary

Issue [#497](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller-judging/issues/497) from the previous Sherlock audit was not fixed in the current code and is still present.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability is well explain in the mentionedl link above, essentially any market owner may change the marketplace fee while frontrunning a borrower and getting more funds in return.

A PR with the fix was mentioned in the comments but it was never [merged](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/pull/81/files).

From the [docs](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/judging), the issue is valid as long as there is not a `won't fix` label.

## Impact

Borrower pays more marketplace fees than expected due to malicious market owner.

   allow lenders to specify the exact fees they were expecting as a parameter to lenderAcceptBid
