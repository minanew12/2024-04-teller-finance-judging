# `OwnableUpgradeable` is not initialized in `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart`

## Summary
`__Ownable_init` is not called to initialize the owner in LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart `initialize` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `LenderCommitmentGroup_Smart contract` is an upgradeable contract that uses the upgradable version of the OZ Ownable contract for managing access control. Since the state is managed in proxy for upgradeable contracts, the `initialize` function is called after deployment to set the initial protocol state in the proxy. It is also necessary to initialize any inherited contracts inside the initialize function to set their initial state.

Since the contract inherits the OZ OwnableUpgrdable, it is required to call the `__Ownable_init` to initialize the owner. However, the initialize function does not do that, resulting in the protocol without an owner, which could lead to some important actions being taken.

```solidity
function initialize(
        address _principalTokenAddress,
        address _collateralTokenAddress,
        uint256 _marketId,
        uint32 _maxLoanDuration,
        uint16 _interestRateLowerBound,
        uint16 _interestRateUpperBound,
        uint16 _liquidityThresholdPercent, // When 100% , the entire pool can be drawn for lending.  When 80%, only 80% of the pool can be drawn for lending. 
        uint16 _collateralRatio, //the required overcollateralization ratio.  10000 is 1:1 baseline , typically this is above 10000
        uint24 _uniswapPoolFee,
        uint32 _twapInterval
    ) external initializer returns (address poolSharesToken_) {
        // require(!_initialized,"already initialized");
        // _initialized = true;

        __Pausable_init();

        principalToken = IERC20(_principalTokenAddress);
        collateralToken = IERC20(_collateralTokenAddress);

     ....
    }

```
## Impact
The contract has an onlyOwner function to pause and unpause the borrowings in an emergency. if the owner is never initialized these functions are useless and the system can incur a great loss in the event of an emergency.
