# First Depositor Attack Still Works With Some Adjustments

## Summary

There are 2 of the mitagations for the first depostior attack - exchange rate of 1 when `totalSupply == 0` and internal reserve accounting , but both can be bypassed.

## Vulnerability Detail

**Part 1 - Donating Assets Via Self Liquidation**

The canonical first depostior attack involves sending tokens to the ERC4626 vault to inflate the `balanceOf`. In this case it won't work as internal accounting is used. However, an attacker can instead:

1. Create a loan with a negligble duration
2. Immediately liquidate their own loan by calling `liquidateDefaultedLoanWithIncentive`

The loan incentive is positive when the loan has just recently become default. Therefore `tokenDifferenceFromLiquidations` is increased. This, in turn increases the return value from `getPoolTotalEstimatedValue`

We can see that `rate` increases when `poolTotalEstimatedValue` increases:

`rate_ =(poolTotalEstimatedValue *EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR) / poolSharesToken.totalSupply();` 


**Part 2 - Round From 1 TotalSupply Rather Than Round from 0 TotalSupply**

In the cannonical first depostior attack, the victims deposits when the `totalSupply` is 0. Teller has a mitigation for this:

```solidity
if (poolSharesToken.totalSupply() == 0) {

return EXCHANGE_RATE_EXPANSION_FACTOR; // 1 to 1 for first swap

}
```

This returns 1 share for each asset when totalSupply is 0.

The way to bypass this mitigation is to first deposit 1 asset to mint 1 share as part of the frontrunning attack. The totalSupply is now 1 rather than 0.

The first depositor attack rounds from `0.9999` to `0`. Instead the attacker can make the depositors shares round from `1.9999` to `1`. If the victim deposits `X` principal, the attacker deposits `X/2+1` tokens `X/(X+2 +1) = 1.99999 = 1`

This technique is described in the [ReadMe here](https://github.com/ZeframLou/bunni) under the title "Frontrunning the first deposit may steal 1/4 of the deposit"

## Impact

First depositor can have a significant fraction of their deposit stolen. Additionally the shares can be inflated causing significant rounding errors in the future.

Implement Virtual Assets and Shares similar to [OpenZeppelin's implementation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc4626)
